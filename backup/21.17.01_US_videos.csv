Constance's lovely channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_ClFJYwA3lDagY4igPKddg Labor ethics disclaimer from the brand which the corset was purchased: https://www.adidas-group.com/en/sustainability/people/factory-workers/Despite this disclaimer, however, I was unable to find satisfactory evidence to prove that the brand have established contractual requirements with their manufacturers to ensure that the factories commissioned to manufacture products are paying their employees at living wages. Furthermore, I was disappointed to find that this brand is one of the many guilty of cancelling partly- or fully-completed orders this year without paying manufacturers for labor performed. For this reason, I do not endorse this brand and I do consider this purchase to be in violation of my anti-fast fashion endeavors. Though I won‚Äôt be returning the item, as that doesn‚Äôt do anything productive, I will upcycle it into something I can use‚Äîand intend to give the purchase of this garment a net-positive outcome by donating the ad revenue from this video to the Clean Clothes Campaign (https://cleanclothes.org/about), an organisation which is dedicated to improving garment worker rights and conditions worldwide. https://goodonyou.eco/adidas-ethical/2019 report on brands and ethical labor policies/future plans: https://labourbehindthelabel.org/report-tailored-wages-uk-2019/https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/company-profile/adidas-agSOURCES & FOOTNOTES:Due to character limitations, the full page of footnotes can be found here: https://bernadettebanner.co.uk/sports-corsetsGartland, Elizabeth.

When the Girls Came Out to Play: The Birth of American Sportswear. Massachusetts, University of Massachusetts Press, August 2, 2006.*I actually disagree with this; I mean, yes, it *could* probably be worn over another corset, but the advertisement declares that this corselet 'supersedes the corset' and highlights its intention to be worn only on the upper part of the body, allowing for perfect freedom of movement in the lower. I think they've drawn this conclusion because of the strange little buttoned tabs coming out the bottom of it, but the advertisement shows the woman using these tabs to button the waist of her skirt in place. Since the Khiva corselet is very short in length, it wouldn't provide that secure anchor point at the waist that normal, bust-to-hip corsets do.

Up top we're gonna be dropping some big fan theories and then we'll continue with our more traditional breakdown but it's all gonna be time coded in the description below.Now the last time we saw Vision he was giving a piece of his mind to Thanos and Wanda was moping around after the Avengers saved the universe. Cheer up love it's a funeral.Now the series itself picks up with us having very little idea over what it is that's exactly going on and why the character are in this strange 1950s sitcom world.Now in death Vision actually turned grey and this was very similar to his silver costume in the comics that became a big part of the character. Though we know from the trailers that that won't remain I love the black and white aesthetic here that sort of ties into that Easter Egg and who knows he may turn back to being grey at some point.As for Wanda she has clearly created this pocket dimension and though we don't know exactly what's going on just yet there was a big clue in one of the tv spots that was recently released. Now I just wanna give a huge shoutouts to @kwistatz on twitter for sending me this through and the trailer ends like most do with a voice over announcing when it's coming out. However instead of saying streaming friday it sounds like he says dreaming friday and when you turn on closed captions you can see that this is indeed the case.-This mistake seems deliberate and to me it's hinting that Wanda is actually dreaming this entire reality and due to her powers it may have manifested. This could mean that the character is actually asleep at the centre of it all and the reality is building up around her.The characters that we see could have been sucked into this and this is why they are unable to remember what's going on outside of their reality. The people that we see the pair interact with could be doctors or psychologists on the outside trying to help her with her grief and they've become trapped in the dimension unable to escape from it.Visions Tie also could be hinting at people being enclosed in something and from what we see it has a rectangle with two dots inside of it. These two dots could represent both Wanda and Vision who are trapped inside this box that the former has dreamt up.‚ñ∫ Artist AttributionLofi Geek @Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3g16PgrLofi Geek Official Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyD59CI7beJDU493glZpxgAArtwork @mb0sco","1004.0"

Not S4 episode 5 was called declaration of war, and it begins with a brief flashback to Paradis island, during the time in which Reiner, Annie and Bertholt were infiltrating the walls.After the opening we see Willy Tybur preparing for his stage production, where he will be declaring war on Paradis island infront of journalists and diplomats from around the world. Unlike his usual confident self, Willy is visibly shaken in this moment. In episode 4 of the final season, commander Magath informed Willy that there was an infestation of rats in Marley, by which he meant that there are spies from Paradis island currently in the country. Moving on, Reiner comes face to face with Eren in this dimly lit cellar, and he can barely believe what he‚Äôs seeing. Eren orders Reiner to sit down and you can see that Falco is confused by their reactions. As I explained in my last review, Falco believes the two men are old friends, so Reiner‚Äôs blank expression is not exactly what he was expecting. Eren explains that the cellar they‚Äôre in is underneath a regular apartment building behind the stage. Obviously Reiner is aware of the threat, so he complies with Eren‚Äôs request to sit down, followed by an awkward silence in which Falco offers to leave. We then go back to Eren, Falco and Reiner, as the warrior finally musters up the courage, to ask Eren what he came here to do. Eren replies in epic fashion by telling Reiner he came to do the same thing that Reiner did himself, which is referring back to the attack on the walls all those years ago. Meanwhile the performance of Willy Tybur begins and along with the help of his cast and crew, he tells the story of how the eldian empire took over the world with the titans, after their ancestor Ymir gained the power all those years ago. While the performance continues, the soldier who approached the warriors tells Zeke to go to the front gate and leads Porco and Pieck to a different location. The solider leads the two warriors into a secluded property, before cutting the rope on a trap door and allowing the two to fall down a shaft.Back in the cellar, Falco begins to think about why Reiner looks so frightened and questions who exactly Mr Kruger really is. Because Eren claimed he was Reiner‚Äôs old friend, Falco realises that if they knew each other for so long, then in theory Eren could be someone from Paradis island. On stage, Willy Tybur‚Äôs performance then takes an interesting turn, as he begins to reveal the truth about the great titan war, which the Tybur family had kept a secret for over 100 years. It was revealed in the last episode, that the Tybur‚Äôs had secretly been in control of Marley since the great titan war, which is one of the things they gained by working with the king, in addition to their assured safety. Together with the Tybur‚Äôs, Fritz wanted to present a Marleyan as being responsible for ending the Eldian empire and Helos fulfilled that role. Fritz made a BINDING vow to renounce all war, which is why his successors such as Uri Reiss and Freida Reiss were unable to use the full power of the founding titan. They were always overtaken by Karl Frtiz‚Äôs ideology, and so even when titans were attacking their people, the vow renouncing war prevented them from taking real action. The attack titan manifests itself, completely destroying the cellar that Reiner and Falco were in, as well as the building full of civilians. He emerges infront of the diplomat and journalists from around the world, before crushing the stage and Willy Tybur with his bear hands. This moment was so iconic and I think it was done incredibly well, but let me know what you guys think down below.","804.0"

Images from the riot show Brock inside the U.S. Senate chamber with white flex cuffs.Cameras weren't allowed inside the federal courthouse in Fort Worth. The Monday hearing lasted just five minutes and Brock was escorted into the courtroom by two U.S Marshals.A judge determined Brock qualified for a court-appointed defense attorney. Brock was then ordered held in the custody of the U.S. Marshals until his probable cause and detention hearing scheduled for Thursday.A mug shot, released by the grapevine police department shortly afterward Monday‚Äôs appearance, shows how brock looked at the time of the brief hearing. His hands were cuffed in front of his black t-shirt and his legs shackled around his jeans.The retired lieutenant colonel in the Air Force Reserves was identified by his ex-wife as the man photographed -- and captured on surveillance video wearing combat gear and items to potentially detain and arrest people on the senate floor during the January 6 Capitol riot.The arrest affidavit quoted Brock's ex-wife, who reportedly called the FBI National Threat Operations Center. She said, in part, I just know that when I saw this was happening I was afraid he would be there... It is such a good picture of him and I recognize his patch.There's a wealth of potential criminal offenses in addition to the 2 that they charged that would be available.Richard Roper is a former U.S Attorney for the Northern District of Texas not associated with the case and said video evidence will be key in prosecuting.It nails down the identity of the perpetrator, Roper said.According to the affidavit, filed in the District of Columbia, Brock is charged with one count of knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority and one count of violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds. Both are federal charges.There's two charges, essentially a criminal trespass charge being in a place you‚Äôre not authorized to be, Roper said. Both of those charges, interestingly, are misdemeanor charges -- meaning punishment range would be less than one year in prison unless someone carries a dangerous weapon.Brock's defense attorney did not have any comment. But he did say after Thursday's hearing, the case will be turned over to the courts in D.C. since that is where the alleged crimes took place.FOX 4 News is a FOX-owned station serving Dallas-Fort Worth and all of North Texas.","180.0"

Jay Inslee on Friday activated 750 Washington State National Guard members and a large number of state troopers to help protect the Capitol Campus. The National Guard will be in place for at least 48 hours. Because of proximity to the house and senate chambers and threats we‚Äôve heard from folks to enter the building illegally and to be disruptive, the public‚Äôs not going to be allowed [in], said Chris Loftis with WSP.WSP said the response is the largest on the Capitol Campus in the state's history and it serves two purposes, for protection but also to send a message about democracy. The democratic process is important and we're going to protect it. There were some people last week here and in Washington D.C. that disrespected that process and brought violence and we're not going to allow that to happen, said Loftis.
