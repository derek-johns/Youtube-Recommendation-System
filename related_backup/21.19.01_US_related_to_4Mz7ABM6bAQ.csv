Brandon invites former NCAA kicker standout turned Youtube star, Donald 'Deestroying De La Haye, to join the conversation. Dee shares his internet perspective and experience of having to choose between his NFL dreams and being a Youtube personality.  Channing, who doesn't think highly of kickers as athletes, is in disbelief that Dee gave up being a NFL kicker to make videos on the internet while Fred, Brandon and Chad understand that he did what was best for him at the time. The discussion takes a turn to sacred time and leads to a hilarious trip down memory lane of Channing and Chad reminiscing about curiosity and seeing things they couldn't unsee!Bringing it back to sports, Fred and Brandon discuss longevity of NFL careers and how young players need to be more proactive taking care of their bodies and minds, Chad blatantly disagrees on certain aspects.
