What is the lore of the Pokemon world and the design inspirations? And what does it all have to do with alchemy? Let's Go find out!","This is where gamer's use their heads! A somewhat educational channel that wraps learning into fun via learning by proxy of games! Mainly Nintendo games, and mainly Pokemon at that. Answering questions, developing theories, discussing controversies, revealing secrets and lore, and looking at the science of various video games. Sometimes even comic books, tv shows and movies! From the real in depth physics and math, to chemistry, psychology, and even the science of the ancients! That's right! We delve into pseudo-science here! From spirit science to alchemy, if a game borrows from it, we'll analyze it!If you are curious about this channels family friendly nature, I'd personally give this channel a PG rating on about 90% of the videos. Some videos cross into PG-13 territory, but those typically are obvious by the thumbnail, and by a disclaimer at the beginning of the videos.This channel can only thrive with your help, check out the links below to donate!

There are plenty of Pokémon you can’t eat, more that will kill you, and while only a precious few that make a meal to remember, they certainly can be called a top tier meal.

Most cakes are delicious when eaten with a cup of coffee, but what’s even more delicious? A cake that tastes of coffee itself! This coffee coffee cake has a light, silky crumb and a brown sugary flavor that’s perfectly offset by the bitter notes of brewed and instant coffee, which find their way into all three components — the batter, ribbon, and crumb topping.

It’s about you, and your relationship to your family, yourself, and your friends. Being perfect is about being able to look your friends in the eye, and know that you didn’t let them down because you told them the truth. And that truth is that you did everything you could — there wasn’t one more thing you could have done. Can you live in that moment? As best you can, with clear eyes, and love in your heart.
