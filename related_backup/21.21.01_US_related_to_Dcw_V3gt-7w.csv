It was 1,162 days since his last for the club – against Napoli in 2017 – and this one was bundled into goal off his thigh, a testament to determination more than any training ground scheme. Luke Shaw - 6Steady down the left flank for United without doing anything spectacular. Found his man with a couple of crosses but was limited by a hard-working Sterling and had a real wrestle with the City man for much of the match.Paul Pogba - 6Pogba has looked like he has been getting back to his best in recent weeks and looked sharp early on, pouncing on a loose City pass before overhitting a cross. Tried to get United going on the front foot after City's goal and teed up Fernandes for a wild shot but could not be the inspiration.Bruno Fernandes - 5A poor performance from United's key man when they needed him to step up. Harmless long-range shots in either half and a miscued pass to Rashford when United were on the break suggested a player searching for something that was not quite there. Wasted a great chance with 20 minutes to go when the ball sat up for him nicely in the box.Marcus Rashford - 6Fred - 7A fine long ball in the first half from Fred should have been controlled and finished by Rashford but the striker missed his touch. Mopped up loose balls well in midfield and worked hard to limit the opposition.Yet nobody in blue was complaining. The Carabao Cup may be fourth in any elite club’s wish list, but all derby victories have meaning, certainly one that condemns Manchester United to a fourth straight semi-final defeat.Victor Lindelof - 5Returning to the United defence after suffering a back problem on Boxing Day, Lindelof got back up to speed well. He and Maguire had to deal with the challenge of City's attackers not playing in a usual striker role so positioning was key in open play. But it was his missed clearance from the free-kick which allowed the ball to go through to Stones.Harry Maguire - 6Maguire made vital blocks in the league fixture between these teams last month but could not react quickly enough to block the free-kick for the goal when Lindelof made his misjudgement. Glanced a header wide from a first-half cornerAnd bragging rights are bragging rights, whether the taunts come on the factory floor or, in these strange times, over Zoom. #ManchesterUnited #MUFCIt does not bode well for United’s title challenge that this team has got in the habit of losing the big ones, and any fear that City might not be able to hang on as United searched for an equaliser ended when Fernandinho made it two with eight minutes to go.Anthony Martial - 5Like Rashford, Martial scored home and away against City last season but he rarely threatened in this one, badly miscuing his best chance when he had a header from Shaw's deflected cross. Fortunate not to be booked for diving late on as United searched for an equaliser.City won a corner, taken on the right by Kevin De Bruyne and United spurned two chances to clear.Anthony Martial’s clearing header didn’t quite get far enough, but at least it fell to a team-mate, Aaron Wan-Bissaka. Sadly, his header was absolutely dismal. Tame and short and straight to Fernandinho who struck a low shot from outside the area.","The LATEST in Players and Coaches gossips and entertainment news from Soccer Gossips, some of the best pieces from off the field!

Man United sat top of the table going into the game and therefore remain on top after their 0-0 draw, however Laurens, who was at the game and spoke to Harry Maguire, claims the United players were disappointed to come away with the draw and felt they could have taken all 3 points from Liverpool. Luke Shaw also spoke after the game and stated United were unlucky not to win, something Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson disagreed with. Marcotti questions what the issue may be for Liverpool who have now gone four games without a win in the league. Hutchinson believes Jurgen Klopp's men are getting stale and Klopp needs to consider signing some top players in January if they are to retain the Premier League title. Hutchinson also feels as though the Liverpool team have been carrying Mohamed Salah and feels he would be dropped if it wasn't for Diogo Jota being out injured.Subscribe to ESPN UK: http://bit.ly/1oGUzVAFollow ESPN UK across multiple platforms:https://en-gb.facebook.com/ESPNUKhttps://twitter.com/ESPNUKhttps://www.espn.co.uk/","Welcome to ESPN UK, home to some of the best sports analysis and discussion on YouTube.Subscribe to keep up to date with all the major happenings in the world of Football.","football video espn premier league nfl american sport nba mma cricket f1","Dcw_V3gt-7w"
