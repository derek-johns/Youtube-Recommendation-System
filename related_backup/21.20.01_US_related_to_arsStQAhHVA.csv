In a video message posted to the long-running game show‚Äôs YouTube channel, Trebek delivered the news with transparency,  humor, and optimism.‚ÄúI plan to beat the low survival rate statistics for this disease,‚Äù Trebek said in the video message. ‚ÄúTruth told, I have to! Because under the terms of my contract, I have to host ‚ÄúJeopardy!‚Äù for three more years!‚ÄùIn addition to being present for the five episodes that were taped that day, Flanagan got to spend a limited amount of one-on-one time with Trebek, who has been hosting the show since 1984.He got an inside look at Trebek‚Äôs pre-show routine, and got the iconic host to open up about his diet, his passion for labor-intensive housework, and the reason he‚Äôs never lost his passion for hosting ‚ÄúJeopardy!‚Äù after more than 7,000 episodes.Flanagan also recorded Trebek‚Äôs interactions with the live studio audience during commercial breaks, wherein he takes unscripted questions. ‚ÄúNo subject is taboo,‚Äù Trebek said.This visit to the ‚ÄúJeopardy!‚Äù set came the day after a category that featured Trebek reciting rap lyrics went viral, making headlines due to his deadpan delivery of verses by artists like Drake and Lil‚Äô Wayne.Business Insider released a series of short videos produced from  the footage captured in 2017. After Trebek‚Äôs announcement regarding his health status captured the minds and hearts of the show‚Äôs massive audience, Flanagan returned to the footage he shot that day to create a new, extended chronicle of his experience.Some of the footage featured here was included in the previously-released videos, and some of it is being seen for the first time.------------------------------------------------------#AlexTrebek #Jeopardy #BusinessInsiderBusiness Insider tells you all you need to know about business, finance, tech, retail, and more.Subscribe to our channel and visit us at: https://read.bi/7XqUHIBI on Facebook: https://read.bi/2xOcEcjBI on Instagram: https://read.bi/2Q2D29TBI on Twitter: https://read.bi/2xCnzGFBI on Amazon Prime: http://read.bi/PrimeVideo--------------------------------------------------A Day With Alex Trebek Behind The Scenes Of 'Jeopardy!'","What you want to know about business.

Here's the untold truth of Alex Trebek's marriage.Alex Trebek first met New York native Jean Currivan, who was a real estate project manager at the time, at a party in 1988, several years after his divorce from his first wife in 1981. The pair obviously hit it off because Alex decided to take a chance and asked Jean over to dinner at his home. She said yes, but not without a bit of apprehension. She later admitted to People Magazine that she was really nervous about getting involved with Alex, saying,I was afraid I'd mispronounce my own name!Surely most Jeopardy! contestants can relate to that worry! Despite Jean's initial apprehension, she explained that the classy host that contestants meet and the intimidatingly dapper man that viewers at home see is different from the person she went on a date with. As she put it,Alex is really down to earth. He's much more casual than he is on the show. It's Alex's job to be astute, perfect, and articulate on the air. But he certainly doesn't want to be that way at home. People think he goes to bed in a suit. He doesn't.While Jean didn't specify what exactly Alex wears to bed, we would guess it's not an old t-shirt and boxers either. Perhaps he opts for some sophisticated silk pajamas?Alex Trebek is quite a bit older than Jean, who was just 24 when they met and 26 when they got engaged. Alex was already 48 when they were introduced and had turned 50 by the time he proposed. And while celebrity relationships with significant age gaps aren't much of an issue for a lot of couples in the entertainment industry, Jean has admitted that the age difference could've been problematic for her. In January 2019, she told People Magazine,I kept thinking, he's 24 years older than me‚Ä¶but there was something that just kept drawing me to him.Alex also talked to People about the age gap back in 1990, noting,At first it worried me. But then I thought, 'The hell with it. We'll make it work.'Jean added,I can understand why he was cautious about being with a younger woman. So I didn't try to push him. We just took it one day at a time.And eventually, one day at a time led to happily ever after for these two.Although Alex was divorced when he met Jean, that doesn't mean he was living alone, as his mother Lucille was his roommate. Luckily, though, having mom around didn't cramp Alex's style while he was dating. In fact, Lucille was quite accommodating. As Alex explained to People Magazine,If I was entertaining, she'd make herself scarce. She was the same way with Jean.Lucille continued to live with the couple after they got married, which didn't seem to be an issue either. In fact, Alex noted,[Lucille and Jean] get along like a house on fire. They squeeze me out.Jean confirmed that she is indeed fond of her mother-in-law and often spends time with her in the evening when Alex isn't around. Considering all these warm feelings, it's no surprise that Alex got a little choked up while sending his mother a special birthday message during a 2016 episode of Jeopardy!A woman named Lucille, who today celebrates her 95th birthday.

After manning the helm for a mind-blowing 37 seasons and 8,200 episodes, Trebek gave us plenty of memories and moments to choose from. But it's one of the last Jeopardy! episodes to air that has us tearing up.On November 5th, 2020, the iconic game show aired as usual. But the post-game chat is when things got emotional. Winner Burt Thakur, who earned $20,400 to become the newest champion, was asked by Trebek if he had any family members back home cheering him on.As the camera panned back to Trebek, he looked almost stunned at the admission, and his impact on his audience young and old was evident. As many touching moments as Alex Trebek left us with, there are plenty of hilarious moments to remember, too. The Jeopardy! host was known for his dry and witty humor, and in one October 2016 episode he really brought it out. In the episode, contestant Susan Cole explains her love of nerdcore hip hop, a genre of music that sprung up at the turn of the millennium thanks to artists like MC Frontalot and MC Chris. It's a style Trebek admits he's never heard of, and he even says it, quote, doesn't sound like fun, but Cole is undeterred. Alex Trebek also knew how to use a joke to support the show's contestants. In 2005, as the show was taping its Tournament of Champions, tensions were reportedly high. Competitors Ken Jennings, Brad Rutter, and Jerome Vered joked that they were all completely pantsless behind their podiums. Trebek was amused by the concept, and decided to join in on the fun.As the Tournament of Champions began, Trebek strode out in his usual jacket, tie, dress shirt, and pocket square, with just boxers, shoes, and dress socks on.Unfortunately for Trebek, the contestants ended up chickening out on their agreement. Trebek demanded the camera reveal all three men wearing pants. Then, ever the good host, he simply strode back offstage while the contestants doubled over with laughter and the audience applauded.Despite how much Trebek enjoyed gently joking with contestants, he still shared plenty of tender moments with them too. One of the most heart-wrenching Jeopardy! moments happened during a 2019 Tournament of Champions episode, which was shot after Trebek shared his cancer diagnosis.Normally during Final Jeopardy, contestants are hunched over their podiums, focusing as they write down their answers. However, as the camera panned over contestant Dhruv Gaur, he just grinned at the audience. Trebek called on Gaur first, noting his smile.Of course, the incorrect answer lost Gaur the remainder of his money, but he earned a place in Jeopardy! lore.Soon, the We Love You Alex' hashtag started trending on Twitter as fans shared their affection for the beloved host. Based on the outpouring of love from fans after Trebek's passing, millions of viewers shared Gaur's sentiments. Trebek's final episode of Jeopardy! will air on Christmas Day, 2020, so get those tissues ready.#AlexTrebekRead Full Article: https://www.thelist.com/275105/one-of-the-alex-trebeks-last-jeopardy-moments-will-bring-you-to-tears/","The List is a women‚Äôs news and lifestyle destination with a twist.

Today, we take a look at some of the lesser known details surrounding Alex Trebek and his legendary career.Alex Trebek was one of the most iconic - and highest-paid - personalities on television. And for good reason too! Alex has always held an intensely high degree of moral character and uncompromising standards. His values have shined through his work in a very obvious way. The esteemed host of Jeopardy helped craft the show into the beloved classic that has been enjoyed by millions of knowledge-seeking fans since 1984. It's true that the game show traces its origins back to the late 1960s but it was Trebek taking the reins of its reboot that turned a once floundering show into the legend that it is today. It's difficult to picture what Jeopardy would have been like without Alex at the wheel. He and the show are downright synonymous with each other. As a host, he has endured decades of experiences that have put him to the test in so many ways that its brainy contestants might not even realize, but he has always powered through struggles and strife with professionalism and a positive mindset. In fact, you would be hard-pressed to find someone that wasn't familiar with the television personality. Even folks without TV sets are likely to be familiar with his name and image. His persona is somewhat larger than life. In 2019, it was revealed that Alex was battling pancreatic cancer and would have to go back in for more treatment. Since then, he has had to come to terms with the fact that he will someday have to say his goodbyes not only to his fans on the air but also to his friends and family. Unfortunately, that day came much sooner than we hoped.Facts Verse Presents to you 18 little known facts that you never knew about one of the greatest game show hosts of all time. Did you know that he once chased down a burglar successfully that was trying to rob his hotel room? He also once purchased a mansion just so he could play tennis on its court. Besides these trivial matters, however, see what has made Alex Trebek one of the most respected public figures in history.Like this content?

Many have dubbed her The Queen of Country, but this humble woman respectfully declines the title, explaining that it would be better suited to artists such as Dolly Parton, Patsy Cline, or Loretta Lynn. Still, her influence on country music, as well as her success as a recording artist, cannot be ignored.Throughout her life, Reba McEntire has released a total of 40 songs which became number one on the top charts. Her album sales have reached a total of $85 million! Finally, out of 33 released studio albums, 28 of these have been certified gold. Out of all the female music artists in the world, this success has been topped only by Barbara Streisand, who has released a total of 52 gold albums.Furthermore, Reba McEntire has also won two Grammys and two bestselling autobiographies. While her acting career has not been nearly as successful as her work as a singer and songwriter, McEntire has found her way into a handful of films and television shows. She was even given her own sitcom, Reba, which ran for a total of six seasons.McEntire certainly hasn't stopped finding new ways to continue her career, either. The country artist is all too aware of how many people want to match her flawless style, and she released her own exclusive clothing line at Dillard's.Although McEntire's singing and songwriting abilities are a huge part of her talent, part of what makes her so successful is her down-to-earth personality, as well as her unique lifestyle. People all over the country fall in love with her warm singing voice, as well as the confident and kind air she gives off during interviews and the like. It seems like everyone would want to be friends with Reba McEntire.Sometimes, though, it's all too easy to forget that celebrities are people just like us. After all, it's not as though they spend their every waking moment getting dressed for the red carpet, filming for movies, or writing songs for their next hit album. So what does Reba McEntire get up to when the cameras aren't rolling? In today's video, we're going to take a look at the secret life of Reba McEntire, including some juicy secrets you probably didn't know about this country icon.

As a headstrong teen determined to become a businessman, ‚ÄúLittle Donald‚Äù may grow up taking after his father. Despite his father‚Äôs willingness to put Barron in the spotlight, mother Melania insists on her son‚Äôs privacy, making young Barron the subject of internet speculation. What we do know is that Trump‚Äôs fourteen year-old son lives a life of luxury, enjoys golf and is even considered to be a ‚ÄúLittle Donald‚Äù. What we do know about the only child of Donald‚Äôs third marriage is he grew up in the Trump Tower penthouse in NYC, where he had an entire floor to himself, and attended an expensive private school. After moving to Washington following his father‚Äôs election, Barron became the first son of a president to live in the White House since JFK. Barron is trilingual, speaking his father‚Äôs native English, his mother‚Äôs native Slovenian, and French, taking on bilingualism as early as age three. The youngest Trump takes after his father with his reportedly stubborn personality, and in his career aspirations. Mother Melania claims he decided at age five that he wanted to pursue a career in business, and his plan B is to become a professional golfer. The teen loves sports, prefers suits over sweatpants, and shares his mother‚Äôs interest in upscale fashion. It‚Äôs hard to tell what's next for Donald Trump's adolescent son, but it‚Äôs likely to include golf.Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheTalkoTwitter: https://twitter.com/thetalkoInstagram: https://instagram.com/the_talkoTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@thetalkoFor more videos and articles visit:http://www.thetalko.com/Written by: Marlena NicoleNarrated by: Carmen S.Edited by: Carla Maria CuellarFor copyright matters please contact us at: legal@valnetinc.com","We‚Äôre your go-to destination for inspirational and motivational content.

From her hands-on parenting to her prioritizing his schooling, here's what we know about their bond.Barron William Trump was born on March 20, 2006, the first and only child of Donald and Melania Trump. Donald Trump reportedly picked the name Barron, a reference to an alias he used when speaking to the press John Barron according to The Washington Post. Apparently as early as 1980, Donald would actually act as his own spokesman, giving the media a different name when he talked to them.Though much has been written about the origin of the Barron moniker, not much exists about his middle name except for Melania Trump's involvement. Houston Chronicle reported that Melania got to pick Barron's middle name, William.Keep watching to find out what is really going on with Melania and Barron Trump.#BarronTrump #MelaniaTrump #DonaldTrumpMelania's only child | 0:00Raised by mom | 0:52A guiding influence | 2:19An independent boy | 3:03Teaching right from wrong | 3:37Being a mom first | 4:22Multilingual upbringing | 5:10Standing up for her son | 5:49Off the trail | 6:50Protective mom | 7:38Read Full Article: https://www.thelist.com/271784/the-truth-about-melania-trumps-relationship-with-her-son-barron/","The List is a women‚Äôs news and lifestyle destination with a twist.

The virus is currently spreading through every state, and no one is safe including celebrities and politicians. In fact, the list of celebs with coronavirus keeps on growing.On March 16th, 2020, actor Idris Elba announced that he'd tested positive for the coronavirus, tweeting: I feel ok, I have no symptoms so far but have been isolated since I found out about my possible exposure to the virus. Stay home people and be pragmatic. I will keep you updated on how I'm doing. No panic.In the accompanying video message, Elba explained that he self-quarantined and got tested immediately after learning that a person he'd come into contact with had tested positive three days prior. Elba then explained why he decided to share his diagnosis with the world:He goes on to say, If you're feeling ill, or you feel like you should be tested, or if you've been exposed, then do something about it.Elba ended the video by saying,Look, we live in a divided world right now. We can all feel it. [...] But now is the time for solidarity. Now's the time for thinking about each other. [...] Stay positive.

Residents of the private island, which is also known as the Billionaire Bunker and consists of only 29 homes, include footballer Tom Brady and his supermodel wife Gisele B√ºndchen, supermodel Adriana Lima, former Miami Dolphins coach Don Shula, and billionaire businessman Carl Icahn.But if Trump and Kushner were expecting the residents of Indian Creek to roll out the welcome wagon for their arrival, they may be sorely disappointed. Although anyone with enough money can buy a home or plot on the island, not everyone is able to become a member of the highly exclusive Indian Creek Country Club. And, according to a source at Page Six, Ivanka and Jared are considered persona non grata at the club after the recent insurrection at the Capitol. The source explained:You have to be nominated and make a formal application. But it only takes one member to object against any new member, and many members are objecting particularly after the events at the Capitol on January 6th. [...] The Indian Creek Country Club members are very picky and the word is that Javanka need not apply.Unfortunately for the couple, they seem to have become embroiled in the tumultuous events of early January ‚Äî with Ivanka in particular facing criticism for calling the rioters American patriots. So, while the couple and their children will be free to enjoy their 1.8-acre Miami lot, with its 200 feet of private waterfront, it's doubtful they'll get the chance to enjoy the country club's amenities - which include an 18-hole golf course and a restaurant.But that's not all. With Ivanka and Jared's move to the Sunshine State now in jeopardy, it appears that returning to the concrete jungle might not be an option for them, either. The former New York City residents are allegedly on the outs with the city's elite social scene, with many influential New Yorkers telling The New York Times they can forget about ever returning to the Big Apple. As NYC socialite Jill Kargman told the publication:I have had visions of Ivanka with her thousand-dollar hair and makeup trying to show up at the opera like that and getting ejected. The poetic justice is that coming to New York would put them in a kind of prison already.However, shunning the couple could be a strategic decision made by some in an attempt to appear neutral in the typically Democratic state. A source told Vanity Fair:Everyone with self-respect, a career, morals, respect for democracy, or who doesn't want their friends to shame them both in private and public will steer clear.But the same insider notes they will likely be welcomed back by some - especially those who see the Trumps as their best chance at getting near to power. Another source added:They will probably be welcomed by real estate types and that group of Upper East Side and Palm Beach families that read about themselves. And even in that social scene, the source says:There will always be private dinner parties for them to attend, but they will be the entertainment.And while some may not be too pleased to see Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump strolling around the block when they eventually finish construction on their Billionaire's Bunker property, others seem less bothered. Even though Page Six notes their future home will take around two years to build, some locals have already been getting chummy with the Kushners. Noting that the residents on the island are largely Republican, an insider revealed:Ivanka and Jared had already been made to feel very welcome on the island. They had received numerous invitations to dine with their future neighbors.And hey, even if they don't manage to get into Indian Creek's Country Club ‚Äî there's always the Trump-brand golf resort nearby.

But perhaps the incidents that we have seen most often played out in the media have been the awkward interactions, the less-than-subtle expressions, and the eyes she's appeared to have rolled while on the job.In one of her first ever viral moments, Melania's 2016 Republican National Convention speech made headlines ‚Äî and it's no surprise as to why. Given on the first night of the event, it was a near carbon copy of a 2008 speech by Michelle Obama. And, of course, the internet went nuts.After the viral speech and subsequent backlash, the Trump Organization shouldered the blame and eventually assigned the error to staff writer Meredith McIver. According to NPR, McIver claimed that Melania had simply admired Michelle Obama and thus she incorporated some of Michelle's sayings into Melania's speech. But in the face of heated criticism, McIver apologized, saying in a statement,This was my mistake and I feel terrible for the chaos I have caused Melania and the Trumps, as well as to Mrs. Obama. No harm was meant.
