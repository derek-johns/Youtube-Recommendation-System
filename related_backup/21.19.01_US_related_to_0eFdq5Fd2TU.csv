So, after a long break from testing out & reviewing clickbait hack videos (I think the photo and video hacks broke me), we decided to make a comeback into the genre by testing out these viral clickbait soap hacks that lots of hackers seem to love making - from Blossom to 5-Minute Crafts to Craft Factory and back. And you know me, I can't resist me some nice soap :). We tried a cloud soap hack, a gummy bear soap hack, and a cinnamon roll soap hack, and shenanigans ensued. What do you guys think of these soap hacks??Also, a heads up - though we mention it in the video - cinnamon can be dangerous to use on your skin and ivory soap can release fumes when being microwaved (I guess that's why it smelled so bad), so definitely be careful if you take on any of these soap art hacks yourself!!You can check out Katie from Royalty Soap's video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UDhSQYVWssYou can check out the Blossom video that contains our hacks here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I1tMz-VMtgAnd you can check out Jenna's soap hand video here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo3HwJNgi9MThis video is NOT sponsored!!Safiya's Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/MUSICVia AudioNetwork","Double, double toil and trouble!Team Saf:Safiya NygaardTyler Williams","","0eFdq5Fd2TU"

Apologies for the long absence, but we are trying to get things back on track. No, this video didn’t take us 3 months to make - we filmed a bunch of videos in July and this is the first of them to be released! It’s not a magnum opus, just supposed to be fun and lighthearted. If you want to read more about our plans, you can check out my blog post here:https://www.safiyasnewintrosong.com/single-post/2020/09/04/where-have-we-beenNow, onto the video! A few weeks ago, somewhere deep in a visual ASMR YouTube rabbit hole, I discovered the online acrylic pour art community - where people essentially make interesting color combos of paint in a cup, then pour that cup onto a canvas or object - and then manipulate that object to create truly mesmerizing, rainbow, psychedelic pieces of art. And I was instantly hooked - just something about the way the paints flow from the cup and then slide around the canvas really got me, ya know? So I decided to pick an acrylic pour art video and try to follow it myself, to see if I could do it too. So I chose a pouring guru, Tiktus color art, and got to work.What do you guys think of my ~acrylic pouring adventure~?This video is NOT sponsored!!Safiya's Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/Twitter: https://twitter.com/safiyajnFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/safnygaard/The tutorial we followed is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yndPwAMGEggYou can check out Tiktus’s channel here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeAvBShy5a2_vTFflQG_zWgMUSICVia AudioNetwork","Double, double toil and trouble!Team Saf:Safiya NygaardTyler Williams","","0eFdq5Fd2TU"

I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try LOL).

Here is a weird video we made where I mix every bath bomb from Lush together into one, single, franken-bath bomb. Just a heads up - this video was filmed a couple of months ago, pre-quarantine - I would not recommend heading to the mall right now, but I would recommend taking a nice bath, with or without some fizzing bath products. Anyway, I figured - this type of experiment has worked (within reason) for a wide array of products like lipsticks, foundations, and candles - so why not try mixing every single bath bomb from one store together to see what kind of bath we get? It's BATH makeup science. Wait, no makeup. Bad bath science? Idk.This video is NOT sponsored! We did get permission from Lush to film at their store, but we paid for all of our bath bombs!Safiya's Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/Twitter: https://twitter.com/safiyajnFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/safnygaard/Check out our merch here: https://fiendsbysaf.com/MUSICVia AudioNetworkAssistant Editors: Claire Wiley & Emily Linden","Double, double toil and trouble!Team Saf:Safiya NygaardTyler Williams","","0eFdq5Fd2TU"

I plan on using some of these for my squishy makeover series, where I fix and redecorate  old squishies and create custom art creations. Let me know which squishies you think I should use in the next episode in the comments!FOR ANY NEW PEOPLE:Today I am going to be opening a bunch of boxes/packages from my subscribers. Basically fanmail or P.O. box unboxing, BUT most of these packages are used, dirty, old squishies sent to me from people who no longer want them. I like to fix them up, paint over them, customize them and decorate them to create new works of ART for my video series called Squishy Makeovers. Soooooo every once in a while I like to do these videos, looking through all the candidates I've been sent. It's always very interesting seeing which squishies I get and how bad of condition they are. Plus there are some cute extra gifts thrown in from my very generous viewers that are fun to look through. My current P.O. box address is kept private because I have been overloaded with mail in the past, so I only give it out by request to a handful of people each week (email address to request it, bottom of description). The address you see on a lot of the old packages in this video is NOT my current address, I no longer have access to it. Let me know in the comments which squishies you would like to see in the next squishy makeover episode.The 2 channels I mentioned in this video:Graveyard Loon:  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUDnNx1J_6kjLMntl-j0J9gJojo:  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrQoOi94KtFp2cio4SnDhqQ___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh 😂 ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try LOL).

So, it looks like it's here to stay - and if you're looking for your shop tab, check the bottom bar!Hello friends! Today, I return to the land of internet hauls and social media targeted recommendations - with a deep dive into the Instagram shop tab! Previously, I have bought things recommended to me via targeted ads on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat - and when the shop tab was rolled out - peeking its lil head out from behind the explore page - I was instantly intrigued. So I spent an evening perusing the shop tab, finding 3 different common themes of what Instagram wanted me to buy, and then purchasing those things, and trying them out. It was a WILD ride, as Instagram recommended me everything from full-on historical costumes to trendy e-girl fashion. Which outfit was your favorite? What's on your shop tab?Safiya's Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/MUSICVia AudioNetwork","Double, double toil and trouble!Team Saf:Safiya NygaardTyler Williams","","0eFdq5Fd2TU"

Apparently things didn't go very well for her and she left early. Jeffree, his makeup and his hair guy were talking a lot of mean and horrible things behind Trisha’s back. Things like her hair and her skin, her weight and how much money she makes and stuff like that. Just really mean and nasty comments. A long time friend of Jeffree - Tab posted a video explaining why he does no longer support Jeffree and talked about the Vegas Trip. There are also dms between Tab and Trisha, that show Trisha isn’t making this up and something really happened on that trip.🔴 Get my YouTube Creator MasterClass FREE for 14 days:https://skl.sh/34V3Kvt(You can unsubscribe before your first payment)🔴 Subscribe to my personal finance channel:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWeUT2TcnxwCzJeaMyt3bMQ🔴 Subscribe to my second channel:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt9IIZsLLXwmPcrEVAFhM8Q✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨FOLLOW ME! ❤️ 📸Instagram: @reyrahimihttps://www.instagram.com/reyrahimi/🐦Twitter: @rey_rahimihttps://twitter.com/rey_rahimi🎶TikTok: @reyrahimihttps://www.tiktok.com/@reyrahimi✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨🔗LINKS:- Earn cashback money with Rakuten: https://www.rakuten.com/r/REYHAN24?eeid=28187- Earn cashback money with Honey: https://www.joinhoney.com/ref/v9nj9lh✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨For business inquiries: reyhanehrahimi2@gmail.com✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨📺WATCH: I paid for ____'s OnlyFans so you don't have to:- Trisha paytas: https://youtu.be/LMT2ZbeMcbI- Nikocado Avocado: https://youtu.be/ahUGQLXljF0- Onision: https://youtu.be/3d_CWo6eov0- Lena the Plug: https://youtu.be/Q__mMarUnjk- iDubbbz's Girlfriend: https://youtu.be/qBCcw8PjHs4- Nick Snider: https://youtu.be/SIKV3GKX4zs- My subscribers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyBTtSeW2Ak&t=683s- Trisha Paytas (YET AGAIN): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGsW1T5VTqE&t=314sI- Tana Mongeau: https://youtu.be/IZaDei0YGeU- Trisha Paytas' sister: https://youtu.be/4-bE0AC1erQ- Venus Angelic: https://youtu.be/MlvIWBliQKA- Belle Delphine: https://youtu.be/kFKZrzdg9bc- Aaron Carter: https://youtu.be/7o-rbXxEzAI","Hi my name is Rey Rahimi and I spill tea","tea spill news spilled youtubers david dobrik logan paul jake tana mongeau trisha paytas rey rahimi rey rahimi","0eFdq5Fd2TU"

Sunt Mircea Bravo și acest clip este realizat cu ajutorul echipei mele (scenariști, cameramani, oameni pe regie, actori, oameni la montaj). Ne dăm cu toții silința să creăm cel mai bun conținut pentru voi și să fim de fiecare dată originali în idei și execuție. Cine vine cu o idee copiată este exclus din echipă. Glumesc. Doar îl batem până se jură că nu mai fură. Am început în 2014 cu diverse videouri cu camera ascunsă (așa-zisele farse). Am fost prin toată țara, am filmat în Cluj-Napoca, București, Timișoara, Constanța, Iași, Târgu-Mureș, Alba-Iulia, Zalău, Bistrița, în principiu peste tot. După un an, lumea a început să mă recunoască și nu mai puteam face farse. Pentru mine a fost un moment greu. Dar colegului meu, Cristian, i-a venit ideea să filmăm cu camera la vedere, sub forma unui reportaj, transformând astfel dezavantajul notorietății într-un avantaj. Astfel, am început să călătorim și să filmăm prin lume (Marea Britanie, Franța, Spania, Belgia, Rusia, Austria etc.). Ne-am propus ca prin fiecare reportaj să vă facem să râdeți, dar și să vă oferim informații valoroase despre locurile în care am filmat: INFOTAINMENT. De la information + entertainment. Știu că v-ați prins oricum din prima. Prin aceste reportaje am prezentat tot felul de evenimente, destinații, festivaluri, lucruri interesante. În 2016 am hotărât să facem încă un pas. Așa au apărut primele noastre scheciuri. Mici filme la care era nevoie de cameramani, actori, scenariu scris dinainte, tot felul. Ca orice lucru de care ne-am apucat, evident că și la scheciuri am vrut să fim cei mai buni și să vă oferim calitate. Ne-am extins echipa, am adus cel mai bun cameraman, cel mai bun sunetist. Să fie o plăcere să vă uitați la videouri. Știți când vă zgârie la urechi sunetul la anumite scheciuri? Noi am zis că nu vă putem face asta. Mai apoi am adus în echipă oameni care să se ocupe de scenarii, oameni pe idei. Și cu idei. Pentru că ar fi imposibil ca un singur om să aibă în fiecare săptămână o idee tare de video. Eu așa zic. Sunt sigur că nu toate videourile vă plac. Nu-i nimic, nu vă întristați, e normal. Unele se adresează tinerilor sub 20 de ani, altele celor peste 30. Tot tineri și ei. Dar vreau să vă asigur că fiecare video e creat ca să vă facă să râdeți. Vă mulțumim că ne urmăriți și, după cum știți deja, puteți să ne susțineți prin like, comment, share, subscribe, follow, stalking etc. Dacă le faceți măcar pe primele trei, hai patru, sunteți fani categoria I.","Pentru contact, colaborări sau booking:  office@mirceabravo.ro","mircea bravo farsa cluj romania prank","0eFdq5Fd2TU"
