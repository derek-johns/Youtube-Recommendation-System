So, after a long break from testing out & reviewing clickbait hack videos (I think the photo and video hacks broke me), we decided to make a comeback into the genre by testing out these viral clickbait soap hacks that lots of hackers seem to love making - from Blossom to 5-Minute Crafts to Craft Factory and back. And you know me, I can't resist me some nice soap :). We tried a cloud soap hack, a gummy bear soap hack, and a cinnamon roll soap hack, and shenanigans ensued. What do you guys think of these soap hacks??Also, a heads up - though we mention it in the video - cinnamon can be dangerous to use on your skin and ivory soap can release fumes when being microwaved (I guess that's why it smelled so bad), so definitely be careful if you take on any of these soap art hacks yourself!!You can check out Katie from Royalty Soap's video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UDhSQYVWssYou can check out the Blossom video that contains our hacks here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I1tMz-VMtgAnd you can check out Jenna's soap hand video here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo3HwJNgi9MThis video is NOT sponsored!!Safiya's Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/MUSICVia AudioNetwork","Double, double toil and trouble!Team Saf:Safiya NygaardTyler Williams","","0eFdq5Fd2TU"

Apologies for the long absence, but we are trying to get things back on track. No, this video didn‚Äôt take us 3 months to make - we filmed a bunch of videos in July and this is the first of them to be released! It‚Äôs not a magnum opus, just supposed to be fun and lighthearted. If you want to read more about our plans, you can check out my blog post here:https://www.safiyasnewintrosong.com/single-post/2020/09/04/where-have-we-beenNow, onto the video! A few weeks ago, somewhere deep in a visual ASMR YouTube rabbit hole, I discovered the online acrylic pour art community - where people essentially make interesting color combos of paint in a cup, then pour that cup onto a canvas or object - and then manipulate that object to create truly mesmerizing, rainbow, psychedelic pieces of art. And I was instantly hooked - just something about the way the paints flow from the cup and then slide around the canvas really got me, ya know? So I decided to pick an acrylic pour art video and try to follow it myself, to see if I could do it too. So I chose a pouring guru, Tiktus color art, and got to work.What do you guys think of my ~acrylic pouring adventure~?This video is NOT sponsored!!Safiya's Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/Twitter: https://twitter.com/safiyajnFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/safnygaard/The tutorial we followed is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yndPwAMGEggYou can check out Tiktus‚Äôs channel here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeAvBShy5a2_vTFflQG_zWgMUSICVia AudioNetwork","Double, double toil and trouble!Team Saf:Safiya NygaardTyler Williams","","0eFdq5Fd2TU"

Today I am going to be painting and customizing a pair of my white vans. Shoes are such a fun item to paint, and I have so many ideas for ways to decorate these. I hope I give you some inspiration for a fun painting project! I love making custom shoes because you can really put your own style on them and make them personal to you (even if you never actually wear them lol).

Here is a weird video we made where I mix every bath bomb from Lush together into one, single, franken-bath bomb. Just a heads up - this video was filmed a couple of months ago, pre-quarantine - I would not recommend heading to the mall right now, but I would recommend taking a nice bath, with or without some fizzing bath products. Anyway, I figured - this type of experiment has worked (within reason) for a wide array of products like lipsticks, foundations, and candles - so why not try mixing every single bath bomb from one store together to see what kind of bath we get? It's BATH makeup science. Wait, no makeup. Bad bath science? Idk.This video is NOT sponsored!

Royalty Soaps also participates in commission or discount affiliations, like Amazon or RewardStyle, as these opportunities become available, like Amazon and RewardStyle and while the money we make with these links isn't much, every little bit counts and once again, we really appreciate your support!

I plan on using some of these for my squishy makeover series, where I fix and redecorate  old squishies and create custom art creations. Let me know which squishies you think I should use in the next episode in the comments!FOR ANY NEW PEOPLE:Today I am going to be opening a bunch of boxes/packages from my subscribers. Basically fanmail or P.O. box unboxing, BUT most of these packages are used, dirty, old squishies sent to me from people who no longer want them. I like to fix them up, paint over them, customize them and decorate them to create new works of ART for my video series called Squishy Makeovers. Soooooo every once in a while I like to do these videos, looking through all the candidates I've been sent. It's always very interesting seeing which squishies I get and how bad of condition they are. Plus there are some cute extra gifts thrown in from my very generous viewers that are fun to look through. My current P.O. box address is kept private because I have been overloaded with mail in the past, so I only give it out by request to a handful of people each week (email address to request it, bottom of description). The address you see on a lot of the old packages in this video is NOT my current address, I no longer have access to it. Let me know in the comments which squishies you would like to see in the next squishy makeover episode.The 2 channels I mentioned in this video:Graveyard Loon:  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUDnNx1J_6kjLMntl-j0J9gJojo:  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrQoOi94KtFp2cio4SnDhqQ___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh üòÇ ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try LOL).

Today, I return to the land of internet hauls and social media targeted recommendations - with a deep dive into the Instagram shop tab! Previously, I have bought things recommended to me via targeted ads on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat - and when the shop tab was rolled out - peeking its lil head out from behind the explore page - I was instantly intrigued. So I spent an evening perusing the shop tab, finding 3 different common themes of what Instagram wanted me to buy, and then purchasing those things, and trying them out. It was a WILD ride, as Instagram recommended me everything from full-on historical costumes to trendy e-girl fashion. Which outfit was your favorite? What's on your shop tab?Safiya's Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/MUSICVia AudioNetwork","Double, double toil and trouble!Team Saf:Safiya NygaardTyler Williams","","0eFdq5Fd2TU"

Sunt Mircea Bravo »ôi acest clip este realizat cu ajutorul echipei mele (scenari»ôti, cameramani, oameni pe regie, actori, oameni la montaj).

Dar colegului meu, Cristian, i-a venit ideea sƒÉ filmƒÉm cu camera la vedere, sub forma unui reportaj, transform√¢nd astfel dezavantajul notorietƒÉ»õii √Æntr-un avantaj. Astfel, am √Ænceput sƒÉ cƒÉlƒÉtorim »ôi sƒÉ filmƒÉm prin lume (Marea Britanie, Fran»õa, Spania, Belgia, Rusia, Austria etc.). Ne-am propus ca prin fiecare reportaj sƒÉ vƒÉ facem sƒÉ r√¢de»õi, dar »ôi sƒÉ vƒÉ oferim informa»õii valoroase despre locurile √Æn care am filmat: INFOTAINMENT. De la information + entertainment. »òtiu cƒÉ v-a»õi prins oricum din prima. Prin aceste reportaje am prezentat tot felul de evenimente, destina»õii, festivaluri, lucruri interesante. √én 2016 am hotƒÉr√¢t sƒÉ facem √ÆncƒÉ un pas. A»ôa au apƒÉrut primele noastre scheciuri. Mici filme la care era nevoie de cameramani, actori, scenariu scris dinainte, tot felul. Ca orice lucru de care ne-am apucat, evident cƒÉ »ôi la scheciuri am vrut sƒÉ fim cei mai buni »ôi sƒÉ vƒÉ oferim calitate. Ne-am extins echipa, am adus cel mai bun cameraman, cel mai bun sunetist.

I am an aspiring entertainer caught up trying to make something out of myself and follow my aspirations in these tough times. I believe I have a uniquely creative mind and if you are reading this, then you must be interested/curious. I just want you to know that I really APPRECIATE your support. Please don't take offense to anything I do or say, I have good intentions but I'm not afraid to take chances and rattle cages. I only ask that you hear me out and maybe I can share a different perspective that will interest you.If you enjoy my work, PLEASE SHARE IT! A retweet or a subscription or any kind of exposure would help me out a lot because it's tough to get noticed and I would like more eyes on my work to give me a proper chance  to be seen.Regardless, I thank you for your time and I only hope that I entertained you and maybe even brought a smile to your face to break up the monotony of this difficult life.","","0eFdq5Fd2TU"
