This is the extended footage from Dream's channel of the Minecraft Speedrunner VS 4 Hunters FINALE video.World Seed: -4221063993078745765Original Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDkuUZ3F1GUI thought I'd upload this sort of like a live stream. There's lots of silent bits and there's no music to set the mood, but hopefully it's not too boring! Most manhunts are around this long.Unsure on if I'll do this in the future, but if you guys really like stuff like this maybe I will! I might instead make an Extended Cut or something that has full fight scenes rather than leaving in the uninteresting stuff.There are points in this video where I check my phone, or I check my discord, or people grab snacks or go to the bathroom or stuff, obviously it's a long recording. Sometimes if I'm standing still or something that might be why. There's kind of awkward silences as well, but that's just what happens when you're focusing!

This video is meant to refute these claims. I encourage everyone to watch until the end, especially if they watched the original video.In this video we hear from a statistical expert with a PhD that wrote a 19 page analysis on what the mods did wrong. I also disprove some of the claims made in the original video.
