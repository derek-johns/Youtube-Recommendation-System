Tells you a lot about the credibility of these tech reporters, which, in case you didn't already know, are run by Vox (which should be warning enough already).  Their how-to guide video was posted September 13th, 2018, and less than a week later, Vox would take down this video, accuse it's critics of toxicity, harassment, and racism, before ultimately issuing illicit copyright takedown notices to Youtubers who posted responses addressing it's various errors, poor instruction, and misinformation.  The Verge cited editorial standards as the reason for retracting the video, but that evidently hasn't stopped them before and it wasn't until an informed audience revealed their entire company to be a sham that they did anything about it.Please Remember: The Verge is a company of Vox journalists, they are not to be considered in touch with any dimension of reality.Their accompanying, albeit amended, article is still viewable.

Still, as an exercise in understanding the graphics capabilities of a modern game console (the PlayStation 5 was used here), we set forth on matching the Sony PlayStation 5's 120FPS Mode graphics settings against a PC, the latter of which has individual controls for various in-game options. Once we matched the settings to be roughly equal, we ran benchmarks against GPUs (and one CPU) until we found a performance threshold roughly equal to the average FPS / frametime performance of the PlayStation 5. This gives us a relatively like-for-like comparison to better understand what the PS5 is comparable to -- it's about a GTX 1060, 1070, and 1080, depending on game, when not running ray tracing. Ray tracing would be something we need to test once more games support it on the consoles. Testing includes a grouping of three games, but the overall concept extrapolates to other games as well. We've established a range of performance to estimate rasterization performance at equal graphics quality (roughly) between the devices. Again, we think the PlayStation 5 and other consoles fill an important role in the market that can't be simply replaced by a PC, and likewise, a PC offers a lot of extensibility not given by a console. They both have an important place and thus this is more of an academic exercise in determining the performance and quality equivalence.DMC5 Special Edition is only available on the PlayStation 5; it does not exist on PC or on the PS4. Borderlands 3 and DMC5 have both had specific treatment for PlayStation 5 and are more than just a backwards-compatible port. An example of a backwards-compatible-only port would be God of War, which is a PS4 game that has not had any treatment for the PS5. You can play it on PS5, but it is a PS4 game without any treatment for the PS5. Miles Morales is unsuitable for comparison because it does not exist on PC.The best way to support our work is through our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/Like our content?
