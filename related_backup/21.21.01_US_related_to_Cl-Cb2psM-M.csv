When reached for comment, the White House did not dispute CNN's reporting.The President later accused Stahl of not wearing a mask and tweeted out a brief clip of her without one while at the White House.A person familiar with the situation told CNN that the image from the tweet shows Stahl with her producers immediately after Trump ended the interview. Stahl had not yet gone back to get her personal belongings to put her mask back on. She had a mask on from the time she entered the White House and just before the interview began.With about two weeks until the election, Trump has spent this week lobbing scatter-shot attacks and growing upset at depictions portraying his campaign as doomed. His truncated taping on 60 Minutes seemed an extension of what has been Trump's visible irritation as he enters the campaign's final days.#CNN #News #Trump","CNN operates as a division of Turner Broadcasting System, which is a subsidiary of Warner Media.

sejcmJ7ZlOc,"LIVE: Biden Ramps Up Covid Fight With Orders Nixing Trump Policies","UChirEOpgFCupRAk5etXqPaA","Bloomberg Quicktake: Now","25","0.0","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sejcmJ7ZlOc/default_live.jpg","[none]","(Jan. 21) President Joe Biden will push for additional travel safety during the coronavirus pandemic by requiring people to wear masks in airports and on planes while enforcing quarantines for people who arrive in the U.S. from other countries.In an executive order he will issue Thursday, his second day in office, Biden will codify an action by former President Donald Trump on Jan. 12 to require a negative Covid-19 test before flying to the U.S. from other nations, according to a Biden administration fact sheet. The order will be coupled with one requiring masks on federal properties that was signed by Biden on Wednesday.The language of the orders hadn’t been released so it’s difficult to assess how the various provisions will be enforced. All U.S. carriers have some kind of requirement that passengers cover their faces, as do many airports and transit systems.But the federal mask requirement could put teeth into policies now written and enforced by the airlines, which have limited remedies, such as refusing to allow customers to board future flights.And it will go beyond airplanes. According to the Biden fact sheet, the administration will require “mask-wearing in airports, on certain modes of public transportation, including many trains, airplanes, maritime vessels, and intercity buses.”While evidence on the risks of flying during the pandemic varies, there is broad consensus that wearing a tight face covering can significantly reduce the risks of transmitting the Covid-19 virus.One of the actions with the highest potential impact is a requirement that people arriving in the U.S. from other nations adhere to what have previously been unenforced quarantine guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The CDC suggests international travelers get a second test for the virus within three to five days after arrival and that they stay at home or in isolation for seven days -- even if the test is negative. For people who don’t get tested, it’s safest to isolate for 10 days, the CDC says.Similar restrictions in the U.K. have reduced travel and have been opposed by airlines and others in the travel industry, who have said aggressive testing should be enough to slow spread of the disease.“The Executive Order also calls for the consideration of additional public health measures in domestic travel,” according to the Biden fact sheet.Adherence to the airline mask requirements have at times been spotty, and there are exceptions for when passengers must eat and drink. Aside from persuasion, the only tool for airlines if passengers refuse is to prohibit them from taking the flight.---Subscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2TwO8GmBloomberg Quicktake brings you live global news and original shows spanning business, technology, politics and culture.

Mike recounts that night in D.C., on the brink of Trump's presidency (and Women's March the following day) and also shares new thoughts on how, four years later, in a militarized Green Zone in our nation's Capital, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris take the reigns of a beaten and bruised nation, but one full of promise.Read the original Langston Hughes poem:https://poets.org/poem/let-america-be-america-againMusic in the episode:Hallelujah - Performed by Yolanda Adams at Biden/Harris Inauguration Eve Covid Memorial Eventhttps://youtu.be/iohM2wnouDoHallelujah - Leonard Cohenhttps://open.spotify.com/track/6s1mt6e0n8G7jcNhcxXKzqNew Rumble Underwriter!

Trump’s ban came shortly after sending a series of tweets condemning the Jan. 6 violence and calling for those involved to go home peacefully. But for several months, a tweet from Iranian leader Ali Khamenei calling for the explicit destruction of Israel, remained on Twitter, free of censorship. A more recent tweet from the Chinese Embassy praising the Uyghur concentration camps also remained uncensored, prior to its removal after widespread complaints that Twitter’s rules were not being applied consistently. The U.S. State Department, on Trump's last full day in office, labeled the actions in Uyghur concentration camps in China as genocide. Campus Reform asked students at Virginia Tech if they supported Trump’s removal from Twitter. While many said yes, they were shocked to hear that Twitter had allowed these other tweets calling or supporting violence to remain on their platform. In light of knowing this, do these students believe Twitter holds a double standard?

In addition, he wrote several Boston organized-crime books and two novels. Howie is also a Columnist for the Boston Herald, and has won a National Magazine Award for Boston Magazine. Boston organized-crime boss Whitey Bulger was so infuriated by Carr's groundbreaking reporting that he once put out a murder contract on Carr, a story detailed in 2006 on 60 minutes. At his 2013 trial on murder and racketeering charges, Bulger tried to have Carr banned from the courtroom by calling him as a defense witness. Now imprisoned for life, the crime czar still says his greatest regret is not murdering Carr when he had the chance.Carr once taught a course at Harvard, where he had to cross a picket line against himself to get to his class.HowieCarrShow.com","howie carr news politics grace curley HCRN","Cl-Cb2psM-M"
