Undefeated at 13-0 and unchallenged through much of the season, the Crimson Tide put themselves in a special light even among the program's six national championship-winning teams to play for Nick Saban.The departures of multiple stars put the spotlight on an offense that had plenty to replace, but quarterback Mac Jones, running back Najee Harris and especially Heisman Trophy-winning wide receiver Devonta Smith more than answered the call as they led one of the best offenses in Alabama history and showed out for the biggest game of the year with 621 yards of total offense. Their 52 points are the most ever scored by Alabama in a national title game and the most in a Crimson Tide bowl game since 1953. Smith was nearly unstoppable, pulling in 12 catches on his first 13 targets for 215 yards and three touchdowns before leaving the game with a hand injury. Jones got banged up a little bit as well but still finished with 464 yards and five touchdowns on 36-of-45 passing.SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL:https://www.youtube.com/user/CBSSportsHQ FOLLOW US ON:Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/CBSSports/Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/cbssports/Twitter - https://twitter.com/CBSSports#CFP #OhioState #Alabama #NCAA #CollegeFootballPlayoff #CollegeFootballPlayoffNationalChampionship #CFPChampionship #Collegefootball #Football #Macjones #NickSaban #DevontaSmith #JustinFields #RyanDay #NajeeHarris #CrimsonTide #Buckeyes","Sports coverage without the yelling, fake debates, and politics that you’ll find on other networks.
