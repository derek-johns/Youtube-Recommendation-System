Things that simply don‚Äôt fit in with our perception of reality, and some things that pose an existential threat to all human life. They refer to these contained anomalies as SCPs, each of which is accompanied by a number. This is a broad umbrella, as an SCP can range from benign or even actively helpful to downright apocalyptic if ever released.Much like the infamous ‚ÄúMen In Black‚Äù often reported by witnesses in connection with alien sightings, the Foundation works in secret to maintain a sense of normalcy at all costs ‚Äì knowing the chaos it would cause if any of the anomalies they‚Äôre harbouring ever became public.Check out our new channel: SCP Explained - Story & Animation https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8JfkMtNAp44vmzdtnL4wow/üîî SUBSCRIBE TO THE INFOGRAPHICS SHOW ‚ñ∫ https://www.youtube.com/c/theinfographicsshowOFFICIAL?sub_confirmation=1üîñ MY SOCIAL PAGESTikTok ‚ñ∫ https://www.tiktok.com/@theinfographicsshowDiscord ‚ñ∫ https://discord.gg/theinfographicsshowFacebook ‚ñ∫ https://www.facebook.com/TheInfographicsShowTwitter ‚ñ∫ https://twitter.com/TheInfoShowüí≠  SUGGEST A TOPIChttps://www.theinfographicsshow.comüìù SOURCES:http://www.scp-wiki.net/http://www.the13thfloor.tv/2015/10/29/creepypasta-of-the-week-the-scp-foundation/https://villains.fandom.com/wiki/SCP_Foundationhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCP_Foundationhttps://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/SCPFoundationhttp://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-231http://www.scp-wiki.net/kte-2013-kapala-mendeshttp://www.scp-wiki.net/about-the-scp-foundationhttp://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-500http://www.scp-wiki.net/object-classeshttp://www.scp-wiki.net/safe-archttp://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-999http://www.scp-wiki.net/euclid-archttp://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3008http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-294http://www.scp-wiki.net/keter-archttp://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-354http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/thaumielhttp://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7000-jhttp://www.scp-wiki.net/neutralized-archttp://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4991http://www.scp-wiki.net/personnel-and-character-dossierhttp://www.scp-wiki.net/security-clearance-levels#toc5http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2521Content relating to the SCP Foundation, including the SCP Foundation logo, is licensed under Creative Commons Sharealike 3.0 and all concepts originate from http://www.scp-wiki.net and its authors.","Facts are fun, but most are presented in a boring and badly edited videos.

The earth goes through periodic cooling periods known as Ice Ages, with the last Ice Age ending a few tens of thousands of years ago. Today we are resting comfortably in the middle of a mild climate period, which means moderate winters in most places around the world and year-long sunshine in California. But today we're also capable of changing the environment artificially, and are already doing so via uncontrolled release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere which are warming the planet. But with thousands of nuclear weapons around the world primed to detonate, that warming trend could very quickly reverse and send us straight into a man-made ice age. Hello and welcome to another episode of The Infographics Show- today we're asking: how can we survive a nuclear winter?TIMESTAMPS:0:01 Can You Survive A Nuclear Winter? 9:05 How I Survived Chernobyl 17:53 Boy Scout Tried To Build a Nuclear Reactor in His Backyard27:08 The Most RADIOACTIVE Place In The World 33:10 What Is The Nuclear Football (The Briefcase That Can Destroy The World)? 42:10 Should You Be Scared of Russia's Floating Nuclear Power Plant? 49:24 What If We Put A NUKE Inside Yellowstone Volcano?","Facts are fun, but most are presented in a boring and badly edited videos.

Vem ver!Recebi um email do Rodrigo Garcia junto com um v√≠deo que a esposa dele gravou. Vou ler pra voc√™s. ‚ÄúMeu nome eÃÅ Rodrigo Damasceno Garcia, entusiasta da aviacÃßaÃÉo que sou, naÃÉo poderia deixar de ser inscrito no seu canal. Quero que voceÃÇ veja e analise esse viÃÅdeo que estou mandando em anexo. Minha esposa viajou sexta-feira passada (16-05-2020) de GRU para SLZ, ela era passageira do voo 3350 da Latam num A319.  Pedi para ela filmar a decolagem. Acontece que no meio do caminho, o aviaÃÉo fez um pouso naÃÉo programado em BSB, segundo o que ela me disse, o comandante informou um problema em um dos motores. GracÃßas a Deus, tudo tranquilo. Entretanto, quando vi o viÃÅdeo, percebi no segundo 0:34 que haÃÅ uma espeÃÅcie de pipoco no motor esquerdo, de onde minha esposa estava filmando. No final das contas, em BSB, os passageiros trocaram de aviaÃÉo (vi pelo flight radar) para um A320 para prosseguirem a viagem. Obrigado pela atencÃßaÃÉo.‚ÄùVamos analisar ent√£o, olhem que a decolagem come√ßa normal‚Ä¶ E aos 34 seg tem o pipoco mesmo. Eu j√° expliquei todo o fen√¥meno no epis√≥dio 543 mas vamos s√≥ falar desse v√≠deo. Os motores a rea√ß√£o trabalham com uma mistura estequiom√©trica, que √© uma mistura bem definida, X partes de ar para Y partes de combust√≠vel. Quando isso t√° certinho, tudo funciona como um reloginho. Agora se ocorrer um desbalanceamento na quantidade de ar, pode ocorrer esse pipoco. Mas o que poderia causar o desbalanceamento?Diversas coisas - o motor possui diversas v√°lvulas para controlar a quantidade de ar dentro, e se uma falhar, pode ocorrer este surge de compressor, que √© o nome t√©cnico. O pode ser um simples passarinho que tenha sido ingerido pelo motor acelerado, ele causa o desbalanceamento e o pipoco. No caso desse v√≠deo, n√£o foi um surge muito grande, porque ocorreu apenas um pipoco e o motor se recuperou sem perder muita pot√™ncia - e eu digo isso porque se ele tivesse perdido pot√™ncia a gente veria uma tend√™ncia do avi√£o desviar para a esquerda, mas √© poss√≠vel ver que ele mant√©m a linha reta por causa do alinhamento da canoa com a faixa branca do limite lateral da pista. Os pilotos provavelmente sentiram ou ouviram o tranco, mas como ocorreu a recupera√ß√£o e os par√¢metros estavam normais, seguiram viagem at√© Bras√≠lia. Ao chegar l√°, a manuten√ß√£o entra em a√ß√£o, e se foi uma ingest√£o ou se o computador de bordo armazenou par√¢metros excedentes no motor, ent√£o a aeronave √© recolhida para manuten√ß√£o. Ainda bem que esse v√≠deo n√£o foi para algum portal viu Rodrigo, sen√£o a not√≠cia teria sido outra, tipo explos√£o de motor na decolagem, t√° pegando fogo no motor do avi√£o e por a√≠ vaiEspero que tenham curtido a leitura de email ‚úÖ Gostou desse v√≠deo?- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -‚úçÔ∏è Deixe seu coment√°rio üì¢ Compartilhe com os amigos‚úà O Canal Avi√µes e M√∫sicas foi feito para descomplicar a avia√ß√£o e complementar as informa√ß√µes do blog http://www.avioesemusicas.com‚úà Seja Membro do Canal Avi√µes e M√∫sicas: http://bit.ly/ApoiarCanal‚úà Loja do Avi√µes e M√∫sicas: http://bit.ly/CamisetasDoCanal‚úà Livro do Lito Sousa: http://bit.ly/livrosDoLito ‚úà Contato Comercial: comercial@avioesemusicas.com‚úà Seu v√≠deo na abertura: http://bit.ly/EnviarSuaSaudacao‚úà Escreva para o Avi√µes e M√∫sicas: Caixa Postal 3008     CEP 07190-972 - Guarulhos/SPM√≠dia Social‚úà Twitter: @avioesemusicas‚úà Instagram: avioesemusicas‚úà Facebook: http://facebook.com/avioesemusicas‚úàSparkle: https://sparkle.hotmart.com/u/avioesemusicasV√≠deos novos toda Quinta e Domingo √†s 12h00 ou um Extra a qualquer dia.‚úà Vinheta de abertura: Maur√≠cio Duarte / Ivo Duran (@ivoduran)Disclaimer: ‚ÄúThe views expressed in this video are my own.
