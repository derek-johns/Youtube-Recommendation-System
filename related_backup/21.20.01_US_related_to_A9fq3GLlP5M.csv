I don’t know if most of what I point out counts, or if it just makes me seem like a creep. Maybe the marathon just awakened my childhood crush on Sarah Michelle Gellar. But there are still some undoubtedly risque moments too. On a side note, this is actually a pretty good film. I remembered it being kinda dumb, but after watching it after growing up it’s actually got some pretty hilarious humor and some smart dialogue. Not to mention that the scenes where Scooby interacts with the environment are handled beautifully… especially for 2002. It has a unique concept that most live-action films based on children’s shows don’t have nowadays. There are a lot of small things you don’t notice when you’re just watching it like normal. But after going through the entire film in editing there’s a lot of small sound effect and keys that you just don’t consciously notice. Like when Mary-Jane gets introduced there is a church choir in the background. I’ve never noticed that before. And yes, I know. This films script was originally going for a PG-13 rating with a darker tone, and a lot more sexual innuendos and weed jokes. Shaggy was going to be a full on stoner. Daphne and Velma were supposed to a have a relationship of some kind, but, when the first cut was rated R, it was heavily re-edited into the film it is now, where most of these aspects are completely gone. Even though this film still has cleavage galore, that cut apparently had so much that they had to use computer generated content in the final cut to cover it up. And also, yes, I do realize that the leather boots are actually latex boots. I fucked up, what do you want me to say? And for the people who say some of these are reaches, that does not undermine the ones that aren't, and also, I tried to have everything that could even, by the smallest of margins, be considered a risque, dirty, or slightly targeted-towards-people-older-than-12-years joke.

I make shorts and features and post them all on this channel!THE PROMISE:If you make a movie (a feature length film, 40+ minutes) and send it to me, I will watch it. Making movies is so possible nowadays, all my features cost anywhere from $0-$500. I see my promise to watch people's movies as a nice form of encouragement. There are so many systems and roadblocks (and lies) in place that keep us unambitious and apathetic in the medium, and I hope the promise that a filmmaker will watch and care about your hard work can be that little push some may need to create something bigger.I also encourage people to make short films and lots of them! Short films are great grounds for fun and experimentation, and you get better and better at filmmaking every time you make a short. Because shorts are so much easier to make, I can't promise to watch everyone's shorts.Consider supporting my work on Patreon - https://www.patreon.com/joelhaver","Joel Haver","A9fq3GLlP5M"

You’ve come to the right place.  LegalEagle is all about giving you an insider’s view to the legal system.  Have some fun and learn to think like a lawyer.  I get asked a lot about whether being a practicing attorney is like being a lawyer on TV.  I love watching legal movies and courtroom dramas.  It's one of the reasons I decided to become a lawyer.  But sometimes they make me want to pull my hair out because they are ridiculous.  So I created this channel to answer your burning questions about the law and the legal profession.  While all legal movies and shows take dramatic license to make things more interesting (nobody wants to see hundreds of hours of brief writing), many of them have a grain of truth.

I also cover the game's world of Vvardenfell, Soundtrack, Transportation, Seyda Neen, Thieves Guild, Fighters Guild, Mages Guild, House Hlaalu, House Redoran, House Telvanni, the Imperial Legion, the Imperial Cult, the Morag Tong, the Tribunal Temple, and the Main Quest in this retro analysis.

Because all of this takes place in your mind, the dream world is only limited by your own fantasy, no boundaries. You can literally take control of your dream and warp The Matrix like Neo. Fly and soar over cities like Iron Man, Travel through time like Dr. Strange, Fight like a ninja, Re-live childhood memories, Base jump, ANYTHING you can imagine!Theta binaural beats between 4 - 8 Hz are linked to REM sleep, REM stands for rapid eye movement and is the stage of sleep where your dreams typically happen and also the reason why we infuse our music with theta binaural beats.432Hz: Aligning with Nature’s HeartbeatWe don’t always hear a lot of music tuned to 432Hz, because almost everything we hear on the radio or at concerts is tuned to 440Hz (the accepted standard). However, when we do change that tuning, even by a measly 8 wave-cycles per second, the change to our consciousness and our bodies is dramatic. A 2016 study about listening to music during dental procedures found that music at 432Hz relieved anxiety, reduced heart rate and blood pressure, and improved perception of pain levels during surgery. But what is so magical about 432Hz?A key scientific factor in why this particular frequency has the power to calm us down and improve our state of mind lies in something called the Schumann Resonance. German physicist, Winfried Otto Schumann first documented the Schumann Resonance, which is the frequency of the magnetic waves constantly resonating between Earth’s surface and the ionosphere (upper atmosphere). This frequency is about 8Hz and is sometimes called the heartbeat of the Earth because of its constant vibration.8Hz is connected to 432Hz because the two frequencies resonate with each other. Not all combinations of frequencies resonate well with each other. Next time you’re at a piano, try pressing an adjacent set of white and black keys and you’ll hear them clash.Without getting into too much math, tuning A to 432 makes C-notes fall on powers of two in different octaves. So the lowest C we can hear is at 16Hz, then the next at 32Hz, and so on. The first C we cannot hear is 8Hz, the heartbeat of the earth.So even though we can’t hear 8Hz, when we play music tuned to 432Hz, we are playing music that is harmonized with the resonance of the Earth, as opposed to clashing with it.Though most music is tuned to 440Hz, adjusting that tuning by a mere 8Hz has the power to shape our moods, relieve anxiety, and lower our vital signs, demonstrating the unique power of music to change our livesREAD MORE HERE:✦✔ Binaural Beats: https://www.astralcirclemeditation.com/binaural-beats-info/✔ Lucid Dreaming: https://www.astralcirclemeditation.com/lucid-dreaming/✔ Astral Projection: https://www.astralcirclemeditation.com/astral-projection/-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE ASTRAL CIRCLEThe Astral Circle loves to provide you high-quality content for deep sleep and meditation. Our content is directed to all the people that are interested in Solfeggio frequencies, Binaural beats, lucid dreaming, and astral projection. The content on our channel has binaural beats or solfeggio frequencies embedded to enhance the experience of a meditative and relaxed state of mind which can often be a gateway to entering altered states of consciousness and experience profound experiences such as lucid dreaming, astral projection or deep meditation. We believe that meditative music, in general, has the potential to assist the listeners in reaching these altered states of consciousness. In our channel, we put together the frequencies that we believe are the most harmonizing, healing and rejuvenating. The real ability to astral project or lucid dream comes from you, not the music. It is just a facilitator for yourself to go into the right state of mind.You can read more info on our website: ✦ https://www.astralcirclemeditation.com/","The Astral Circle presents high-quality content distributed from our team's library of digital content aimed for sleep meditations, deeper relaxation, and lucid dreaming.Our work entails music and video production as well as working with individual artists and licensing content that compliments our frequency meditation music which is aimed towards providing the listener with a healthy and self-healing induced state of mind which opens up the door to deeper relaxation and acts as a gateway to meditation and altered states like lucid dreaming, astral projection, inner connectedness, etc.We aim to build our community and spread more awareness about meditation and consciousness.Are you a fan of lucid dreaming? or are you perhaps interested in meditation and self-exploration?

It is about finding the stillness that leads to mental clarity, calmness, and physical healing. It allows us to experience all our faculties as a whole person.In life, most things are beyond our control. The only domain that we have influence over, is ourselves, our reaction and action. The world becomes a better place when we can react to it with more self-awareness. For this to happen, we must first cultivate ourselves, and there is no better way to do this than with meditation.
