He's been an embarrassment to the country, embarrassed us around the world. He's not worthy to hold that office, Biden said.However, Biden said he is glad Vice President Mike Pence will attend his inauguration.He's welcome. I think it's important that as much as we can stick to what have been the historical precedents of how an administration changes should be maintained. And so Mike, the vice president, is welcome to come. We'd be honored to have him there, and to move forward in the transition, Biden said.House Democrats are preparing articles of impeachment, expected to be introduced as soon as Monday. The President-elect did not weigh in on whether Congress should impeach Trump and remove him from office over his actions leading up to his supporters' riot at the Capitol this week.He said he and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris are focused on preparing their agenda to combat the coronavirus pandemic and bolster a battered economy.#Biden #CNN #News","CNN operates as a division of Turner Broadcasting System, which is a subsidiary of Warner Media.

It did not reckon with Trump's role in fomenting that violence, nor did it contain a vow to change his behavior.But with 13 days until Biden is inaugurated, the President's comments in a prerecorded video amounted to as much of a concession as he is likely to offer before he departs the White House for good.A new administration will be inaugurated on January 20, Trump said in the video, which was taped at the White House. My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power.A White House adviser in discussions with senior officials said Trump recorded the video only because his presidency is threatened by looming resignations and potential impeachment.I think that video was done only because almost all his senior staff was about to resign, and impeachment is imminent, the adviser said.#ErinBurnett #CNN #News","CNN operates as a division of Turner Broadcasting System, which is a subsidiary of Warner Media.

Mitch McConnell can now close the Senate without voting on $2,000 survival checks. More Senate Democrats - 41, including Chuck Schumer and Kamala Harris - voted with McConnell.Alien Perspective Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Alien-Perspective-111515277387761/Twitter: https://twitter.com/KeeganTatumInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/keegantatum/It's a big club and you ain't in it. - George CarlinThanks to the reporting of David Sirota's the Daily Poster.“I just took to the floor again to demand a vote on $2000 survival checks,” [Chuck] Schumer [leader of the Senate Democrats] declared, and he slammed Republican lawmakers for objecting. He promised: “Democrats will not stop fighting.”Then moments later, Schumer and most Senate Democrats surrendered — live on C-Span for everyone to see, they obediently voted for McConnell’s motion to move forward the defense bill for final passage, so that the Senate can close down without any vote on the $2,000 checks.-David Sirota & Andrew Perez, Daily PosterPut another way: Schumer tweeted out his promise to fight for starving Americans, while knowing that moments later he would be on live television surrendering to Republicans. -David Sirota & Andrew Perez, Daily PosterIn other words, Democrats took their leverage and voted it away.41 Dems, 39 Republicans voted to authorize $740 billion military budget.That includes Kamala Harris.So after Biden worked behind the scenes to lower how much help we get in the stimulus bill that just passed, our soon-to-be VP voted against survival checks.Despite the reality that 78% Americans want $2,000 stimulus checks, Democrats caved on that fight.Looks like we just exchanged one administration that doesn’t care about us for another.It’s heartbreaking to watch Bernie fight for us while Biden and Harris screw us over.We could have actually had a president that cared and fought for us.Republican lawmakers explicitly exposed themselves as greedy nihilists who are willing to starve their own constituents, while enriching their big donors. They are the foremost villains in all of this, as we have reported.That said, rank-and-file Senate Democrats abetted the GOP. They showed a different kind of contempt for their own voters — they were happy to pretend to fight, while always planning to avoid a real battle that might corner McConnell. They were better than the GOP in that they were at least willing to demand McConnell allow a vote, and most of them probably would have voted for the $2,000 checks if they had the chance — but they were never willing to wield their power to try to force a vote.-David Sirota & Andrew Perez, Daily PosterDemocrats didn’t even muster enough votes on the procedural motions to keep it close enough to force Georgia incumbents Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue off the campaign trail to help McConnell — a scenario that could have provided a huge boost to Democratic candidates Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, who have been campaigning hard for the $2,000 checks.-David Sirota & Andrew Perez, Daily PosterKeegan is a democratic socialist and autistic political commentator.
