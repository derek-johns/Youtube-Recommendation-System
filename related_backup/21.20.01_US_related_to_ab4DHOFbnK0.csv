A couple years ago I made a video where I Swedish death cleaned my husband Charlie's closet...and it actually worked!  I fell in love with the method--it works with all your possessions, from big to little.  Even your sentimental clutter.  So come clean and declutter with me.  I feel like we could all use that in 2021.  My last video on how to organize your home using Dollar Tree products landed on the YouTube trending page, and so many of you asked in the comments how to declutter and simplify your life to get organized.  You said you felt overwhelmed, so I made this honest video about how I Swedish death cleaned my home to declutter and live more minimally.  I wouldn't say I'm a minimalist, but living lighter has freed up so much more time to spend with family.  Zero regrets!

Five Minutes Matters - You don't have to finish anything, you just have to start. Five minutes can make a huge difference. 2. Borrow Motivation From Others - Podcasts, audiobooks, Youtube videos, music or a phone call with a friend. If you aren't feeling motivated, don't be afraid to borrow it from someone else.3. Dress For It - What you wear can change your mood and mindset. If you don't feel like cleaning, put on a apron! Don't feel like working out? Put on some workout clothes! Dress for the person you want to be. 4. Eat That Frog - Start with the one task you are dreading the most first. This is make the rest of the day seem easy in comparison and stop you from procrastinating your entire day away.

It allows us to focus on what we're most passionate about, be better parents, friends and family members...and to enjoy this one life we've been given. We don't organize, and I don't really like the word declutter. Rather, we help you PURGE unwanted items quickly, so that you, too, can get out from under piles of stuff and enjoy life!WHO WE ARE: We're Tom and Dawn and we live with our four kids (ages 4-9) just outside of the Twin Cities in Minnesota.

It allows us to focus on what we're most passionate about, be better parents, friends and family members...and to enjoy this one life we've been given. We don't organize, and I don't really like the word declutter. Rather, we help you PURGE unwanted items quickly, so that you, too, can get out from under piles of stuff and enjoy life!WHO WE ARE: We're Tom and Dawn and we live with our four kids (ages 4-9) just outside of the Twin Cities in Minnesota. We took on a minimalist lifestyle about 5 years ago and haven't looked back! We don't miss any of the stuff...none of it!
