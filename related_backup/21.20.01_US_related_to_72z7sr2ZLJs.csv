As a headstrong teen determined to become a businessman, “Little Donald” may grow up taking after his father. Despite his father’s willingness to put Barron in the spotlight, mother Melania insists on her son’s privacy, making young Barron the subject of internet speculation. What we do know is that Trump’s fourteen year-old son lives a life of luxury, enjoys golf and is even considered to be a “Little Donald”. What we do know about the only child of Donald’s third marriage is he grew up in the Trump Tower penthouse in NYC, where he had an entire floor to himself, and attended an expensive private school. After moving to Washington following his father’s election, Barron became the first son of a president to live in the White House since JFK. Barron is trilingual, speaking his father’s native English, his mother’s native Slovenian, and French, taking on bilingualism as early as age three. The youngest Trump takes after his father with his reportedly stubborn personality, and in his career aspirations. Mother Melania claims he decided at age five that he wanted to pursue a career in business, and his plan B is to become a professional golfer. The teen loves sports, prefers suits over sweatpants, and shares his mother’s interest in upscale fashion. It’s hard to tell what's next for Donald Trump's adolescent son, but it’s likely to include golf.Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheTalkoTwitter: https://twitter.com/thetalkoInstagram: https://instagram.com/the_talkoTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@thetalkoFor more videos and articles visit:http://www.thetalko.com/Written by: Marlena NicoleNarrated by: Carmen S.Edited by: Carla Maria CuellarFor copyright matters please contact us at: legal@valnetinc.com","","[]","72z7sr2ZLJs"

Carlson claimed that he was discussing with Fox executives what he described as plans to “expand the amount of reporting and analysis we do in this hour across other parts of the company.” He told his viewers that “the people who run Fox News want more of it, not less.”They are already getting it -- at the expense of the network’s putative “straight news” programs. In the two days following Carlson’s announcement, those shows aired clips from his nightly “opinion” show at least 14 times. Fox “news” anchors and correspondents have incorporated clips from Carlson or his guests into packaged reports; used them as the jumping off point for panel discussions; and featured them in news briefs.#TheDamageReport #JohnIadarola #TheYoungTurks","","[]","72z7sr2ZLJs"
v6UAbhexIMc,"Video fuels questions about 'insider' help for Capitol attack","UCupvZG-5ko_eiXAupbDfxWw","CNN","0","0","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v6UAbhexIMc/default.jpg","[]","One week after the deadly insurrection at the Capitol, there are still more questions than answers on whether any lawmakers or police assisted the pro-Trump rioters.The idea of an insurrection is unheard of in modern US history, and the possibility that lawmakers or allies inside the Capitol were helping only contributes to the uncertainty and worry about the event and what's to come.At least one protest organizer said he coordinated with three House Republicans. There are unverified accusations of a reconnaissance mission one day before the attack. And more than a dozen US Capitol Police officers are under internal investigation for allegedly helping rioters.While President Donald Trump's role in inciting the violence is clear, there are some early indications and accusations that other insiders may have more actively aided the mob.Ali Alexander, a right-wing conspiracy theorist who led one of the Stop The Steal groups, claimed in a livestream video that he planned the rally that preceded the riot with three GOP lawmakers: Reps. Paul Gosar and Andy Biggs of Arizona, and Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama.Brooks spoke at the rally before Trump took the stage, and urged the crowd to start taking down names and kicking ass. In a 2,800-word statement about his involvement, Brooks said he was only telling the crowd to fight back at the ballot box. (Brooks also revealed that a White House official called him one day earlier and invited him to speak at the rally.)CNN previously reported that Gosar associated himself with Alexander's group in recent months. A spokesman for Biggs told CNN that he hasn't ever met or worked with Alexander.Alexander said he hoped his mob would pressure lawmakers to block President-elect Joe Biden's victory through the Electoral College. After the riot was quelled, the three lawmakers voted to throw out Biden's electoral votes from Arizona and Pennsylvania. Their effort failed.#CNN #News","","[]","72z7sr2ZLJs"

Do you replace them with a different actor hoping that your audience won't notice or do you make up some kind of excuse that covers their absence and move on?
