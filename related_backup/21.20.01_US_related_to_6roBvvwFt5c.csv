Here's the untold truth of Alex Trebek's marriage.Alex Trebek first met New York native Jean Currivan, who was a real estate project manager at the time, at a party in 1988, several years after his divorce from his first wife in 1981. The pair obviously hit it off because Alex decided to take a chance and asked Jean over to dinner at his home. She said yes, but not without a bit of apprehension. She later admitted to People Magazine that she was really nervous about getting involved with Alex, saying,I was afraid I'd mispronounce my own name!Surely most Jeopardy! contestants can relate to that worry! Despite Jean's initial apprehension, she explained that the classy host that contestants meet and the intimidatingly dapper man that viewers at home see is different from the person she went on a date with. As she put it,Alex is really down to earth. He's much more casual than he is on the show. It's Alex's job to be astute, perfect, and articulate on the air. But he certainly doesn't want to be that way at home. People think he goes to bed in a suit. He doesn't.While Jean didn't specify what exactly Alex wears to bed, we would guess it's not an old t-shirt and boxers either. Perhaps he opts for some sophisticated silk pajamas?Alex Trebek is quite a bit older than Jean, who was just 24 when they met and 26 when they got engaged. Alex was already 48 when they were introduced and had turned 50 by the time he proposed. And while celebrity relationships with significant age gaps aren't much of an issue for a lot of couples in the entertainment industry, Jean has admitted that the age difference could've been problematic for her. In January 2019, she told People Magazine,I kept thinking, he's 24 years older than me…but there was something that just kept drawing me to him.Alex also talked to People about the age gap back in 1990, noting,At first it worried me. But then I thought, 'The hell with it. We'll make it work.'Jean added,I can understand why he was cautious about being with a younger woman. So I didn't try to push him. We just took it one day at a time.And eventually, one day at a time led to happily ever after for these two.Although Alex was divorced when he met Jean, that doesn't mean he was living alone, as his mother Lucille was his roommate. Luckily, though, having mom around didn't cramp Alex's style while he was dating. In fact, Lucille was quite accommodating. As Alex explained to People Magazine,If I was entertaining, she'd make herself scarce. She was the same way with Jean.Lucille continued to live with the couple after they got married, which didn't seem to be an issue either. In fact, Alex noted,[Lucille and Jean] get along like a house on fire. They squeeze me out.Jean confirmed that she is indeed fond of her mother-in-law and often spends time with her in the evening when Alex isn't around. Considering all these warm feelings, it's no surprise that Alex got a little choked up while sending his mother a special birthday message during a 2016 episode of Jeopardy!A woman named Lucille, who today celebrates her 95th birthday.

Trebek told “Entertainment Tonight” in May 2019 that he wanted to be remembered “just as a good guy.”  Trebek, the host of Jeopardy! for nearly 40 years, died Sunday after battling pancreatic cancer. He was 80 years old. Trebek is survived by his wife, with whom he spent the final day of his life, just as he’d said he wanted to.","Inside Edition is television's longest-running, top-rated, and most-honored syndicated newsmagazine. #1 in News and Politics on YouTube (Tubular Labs).","inside edition inside edition news internet viral","6roBvvwFt5c"

In a video message posted to the long-running game show’s YouTube channel, Trebek delivered the news with transparency,  humor, and optimism.“I plan to beat the low survival rate statistics for this disease,” Trebek said in the video message. “Truth told, I have to! Because under the terms of my contract, I have to host “Jeopardy!” for three more years!”In addition to being present for the five episodes that were taped that day, Flanagan got to spend a limited amount of one-on-one time with Trebek, who has been hosting the show since 1984.He got an inside look at Trebek’s pre-show routine, and got the iconic host to open up about his diet, his passion for labor-intensive housework, and the reason he’s never lost his passion for hosting “Jeopardy!” after more than 7,000 episodes.Flanagan also recorded Trebek’s interactions with the live studio audience during commercial breaks, wherein he takes unscripted questions. “No subject is taboo,” Trebek said.This visit to the “Jeopardy!” set came the day after a category that featured Trebek reciting rap lyrics went viral, making headlines due to his deadpan delivery of verses by artists like Drake and Lil’ Wayne.Business Insider released a series of short videos produced from  the footage captured in 2017. After Trebek’s announcement regarding his health status captured the minds and hearts of the show’s massive audience, Flanagan returned to the footage he shot that day to create a new, extended chronicle of his experience.Some of the footage featured here was included in the previously-released videos, and some of it is being seen for the first time.------------------------------------------------------#AlexTrebek #Jeopardy #BusinessInsiderBusiness Insider tells you all you need to know about business, finance, tech, retail, and more.Subscribe to our channel and visit us at: https://read.bi/7XqUHIBI on Facebook: https://read.bi/2xOcEcjBI on Instagram: https://read.bi/2Q2D29TBI on Twitter: https://read.bi/2xCnzGFBI on Amazon Prime: http://read.bi/PrimeVideo--------------------------------------------------A Day With Alex Trebek Behind The Scenes Of 'Jeopardy!'","What you want to know about business.

Today, we take a look at some of the lesser known details surrounding Alex Trebek and his legendary career.Alex Trebek was one of the most iconic - and highest-paid - personalities on television. And for good reason too! Alex has always held an intensely high degree of moral character and uncompromising standards. His values have shined through his work in a very obvious way. The esteemed host of Jeopardy helped craft the show into the beloved classic that has been enjoyed by millions of knowledge-seeking fans since 1984. It's true that the game show traces its origins back to the late 1960s but it was Trebek taking the reins of its reboot that turned a once floundering show into the legend that it is today. It's difficult to picture what Jeopardy would have been like without Alex at the wheel. He and the show are downright synonymous with each other. As a host, he has endured decades of experiences that have put him to the test in so many ways that its brainy contestants might not even realize, but he has always powered through struggles and strife with professionalism and a positive mindset. In fact, you would be hard-pressed to find someone that wasn't familiar with the television personality. Even folks without TV sets are likely to be familiar with his name and image. His persona is somewhat larger than life. In 2019, it was revealed that Alex was battling pancreatic cancer and would have to go back in for more treatment. Since then, he has had to come to terms with the fact that he will someday have to say his goodbyes not only to his fans on the air but also to his friends and family. Unfortunately, that day came much sooner than we hoped.Facts Verse Presents to you 18 little known facts that you never knew about one of the greatest game show hosts of all time. Did you know that he once chased down a burglar successfully that was trying to rob his hotel room? He also once purchased a mansion just so he could play tennis on its court. Besides these trivial matters, however, see what has made Alex Trebek one of the most respected public figures in history.Like this content?

After manning the helm for a mind-blowing 37 seasons and 8,200 episodes, Trebek gave us plenty of memories and moments to choose from. But it's one of the last Jeopardy! episodes to air that has us tearing up.On November 5th, 2020, the iconic game show aired as usual. But the post-game chat is when things got emotional. Winner Burt Thakur, who earned $20,400 to become the newest champion, was asked by Trebek if he had any family members back home cheering him on.As the camera panned back to Trebek, he looked almost stunned at the admission, and his impact on his audience young and old was evident. As many touching moments as Alex Trebek left us with, there are plenty of hilarious moments to remember, too. The Jeopardy! host was known for his dry and witty humor, and in one October 2016 episode he really brought it out. In the episode, contestant Susan Cole explains her love of nerdcore hip hop, a genre of music that sprung up at the turn of the millennium thanks to artists like MC Frontalot and MC Chris. It's a style Trebek admits he's never heard of, and he even says it, quote, doesn't sound like fun, but Cole is undeterred. Alex Trebek also knew how to use a joke to support the show's contestants. In 2005, as the show was taping its Tournament of Champions, tensions were reportedly high. Competitors Ken Jennings, Brad Rutter, and Jerome Vered joked that they were all completely pantsless behind their podiums. Trebek was amused by the concept, and decided to join in on the fun.As the Tournament of Champions began, Trebek strode out in his usual jacket, tie, dress shirt, and pocket square, with just boxers, shoes, and dress socks on.Unfortunately for Trebek, the contestants ended up chickening out on their agreement. Trebek demanded the camera reveal all three men wearing pants. Then, ever the good host, he simply strode back offstage while the contestants doubled over with laughter and the audience applauded.Despite how much Trebek enjoyed gently joking with contestants, he still shared plenty of tender moments with them too. One of the most heart-wrenching Jeopardy! moments happened during a 2019 Tournament of Champions episode, which was shot after Trebek shared his cancer diagnosis.Normally during Final Jeopardy, contestants are hunched over their podiums, focusing as they write down their answers. However, as the camera panned over contestant Dhruv Gaur, he just grinned at the audience. Trebek called on Gaur first, noting his smile.Of course, the incorrect answer lost Gaur the remainder of his money, but he earned a place in Jeopardy! lore.Soon, the We Love You Alex' hashtag started trending on Twitter as fans shared their affection for the beloved host. Based on the outpouring of love from fans after Trebek's passing, millions of viewers shared Gaur's sentiments. Trebek's final episode of Jeopardy! will air on Christmas Day, 2020, so get those tissues ready.#AlexTrebekRead Full Article: https://www.thelist.com/275105/one-of-the-alex-trebeks-last-jeopardy-moments-will-bring-you-to-tears/","The List is a women’s news and lifestyle destination with a twist.

But while most of the Trumps are making headlines, one family member has managed to skirt the spotlight. 14-year-old Barron Trump is the only son of President Trump and the First Lady - and here's what America's First Kid is all about!Barron Trump is one of five children, from Donald's three marriages. Barron's older brothers, Donald Jr. and Eric, are the children of Donald and his first wife, Ivana. Also from the first marriage is Ivanka, who works as an official assistant to the President, while her husband, Jared Kushner, is a senior adviser. Barron's two older brothers often appear in the spotlight due to their leading roles in The Trump Organization. And all three of the older kids made appearances during their father's campaign, speaking at both the 2016 and the 2020 Republican National Conventions. The siblings were also joined by their younger sister, Tiffany, from Donald's second marriage to Marla Maples, who spoke in support of her father, as well.While Barron may have been absent from the official podium, we're certain he would have been speaking, too, if he were just a little older. And, it's not like he isn't familiar with being on TV… Keep watching to learn The Truth About Donald And Melania Trump's Only Son!#BarronTrump #DonaldTrump #MelaniaTrumpThe youngest Trump | 0:00TV debut on Oprah | 1:14A-list celebrity gifts | 2:05Speaking Slovenian | 3:41Total sneakerhead | 5:00Focusing on school | 5:46Having his back | 6:42Little Donald | 8:20First boy since JFK Jr. | 8:49Hitting the links | 9:37Bend it like Barron | 10:30Trumping his dad | 11:28Read full article: https://www.thelist.com/251060/the-truth-about-donald-trumps-youngest-son/","The List is a women’s news and lifestyle destination with a twist.

He left a successful career to go into politics after the Conservative party signed the Maastricht Treaty, which advocated “ever closer union” between European nations.In June 2016, Farage was a leading figure in the campaign to leave the EU. This gained him the name “Mr Brexit” by the then candidate to the US presidency Donald J Trump whom he came to support at a Mississippi rally in 2016.

But perhaps the incidents that we have seen most often played out in the media have been the awkward interactions, the less-than-subtle expressions, and the eyes she's appeared to have rolled while on the job.In one of her first ever viral moments, Melania's 2016 Republican National Convention speech made headlines — and it's no surprise as to why. Given on the first night of the event, it was a near carbon copy of a 2008 speech by Michelle Obama. And, of course, the internet went nuts.After the viral speech and subsequent backlash, the Trump Organization shouldered the blame and eventually assigned the error to staff writer Meredith McIver. According to NPR, McIver claimed that Melania had simply admired Michelle Obama and thus she incorporated some of Michelle's sayings into Melania's speech. But in the face of heated criticism, McIver apologized, saying in a statement,This was my mistake and I feel terrible for the chaos I have caused Melania and the Trumps, as well as to Mrs. Obama.

Audiences and critics alike couldn't get enough of Samantha and Darrin Stephens. The duo began to feel like extended members of our families as we tuned in week after week. Ratings went through the roof. To say that the series was a success is a bit of an understatement. In fact, half a century later it's still re-ruining in syndication all throughout the world.If you're a fan of the show you probably remember little Tabitha, Sam and Darrin's daughter. Her addition marked a major turning point for the story. She very quickly became an essential addition to the cast and won over our hearts with her cute, endearing ways.Although she could be a bit of a handful as well. She started using magic at a young age - including twitching her nose just like her mother. Samantha and Darrin certainly had their hands full. Tabitha was particularly headstrong and needed extra special discipline. Despite her unorthodox upbringing, Tabitha turned out to be a pretty well-adjusted kid.Well, little Tabitha, portrayed by Erin Murphy, is all grown up now, and we have the inside scoop as to what she's been up after all these years. Some child stars wind up having pretty awful lives, but we think that you'll find that Murphy has found her way. Sure, she might not be a huge Hollywood movie start these days, but she certainly has carved out her own path to success.","For copyright issues relating to our channel please contact us directly at - business@factsverse.com","facts verse viral stories trending story pop culture facts tv shows movie star facts celebrities 60s tv 70s tv pop culture","6roBvvwFt5c"

The show had an ensemble cast featuring Buddy Ebsen, Irene Ryan, Donna Douglas, and Max Baer Jr. as the Clampetts, a poor backwoods family from the Ozarks region of Arkansas[1] who move to posh Beverly Hills, California after striking oil on their land. The show was produced by Filmways and was created by writer Paul Henning. It was followed by two other Henning-inspired country cousin series on CBS: Petticoat Junction and its spin-off Green Acres, which reversed the rags-to-riches, the country-to-city model of The Beverly Hillbillies. The Beverly Hillbillies ranked among the top 20 most-watched programs on television for eight of its nine seasons, twice ranking as the number one series of the year, with 16 episodes that remain among the 100 most-watched television episodes in history. It accumulated seven Emmy nominations during its run. The series remains in syndicated reruns, and its ongoing popularity spawned a 1993 film remake by 20th Century Fox.Like this content?

Residents of the private island, which is also known as the Billionaire Bunker and consists of only 29 homes, include footballer Tom Brady and his supermodel wife Gisele Bündchen, supermodel Adriana Lima, former Miami Dolphins coach Don Shula, and billionaire businessman Carl Icahn.But if Trump and Kushner were expecting the residents of Indian Creek to roll out the welcome wagon for their arrival, they may be sorely disappointed. Although anyone with enough money can buy a home or plot on the island, not everyone is able to become a member of the highly exclusive Indian Creek Country Club. And, according to a source at Page Six, Ivanka and Jared are considered persona non grata at the club after the recent insurrection at the Capitol. The source explained:You have to be nominated and make a formal application. But it only takes one member to object against any new member, and many members are objecting particularly after the events at the Capitol on January 6th. [...] The Indian Creek Country Club members are very picky and the word is that Javanka need not apply.Unfortunately for the couple, they seem to have become embroiled in the tumultuous events of early January — with Ivanka in particular facing criticism for calling the rioters American patriots. So, while the couple and their children will be free to enjoy their 1.8-acre Miami lot, with its 200 feet of private waterfront, it's doubtful they'll get the chance to enjoy the country club's amenities - which include an 18-hole golf course and a restaurant.But that's not all. With Ivanka and Jared's move to the Sunshine State now in jeopardy, it appears that returning to the concrete jungle might not be an option for them, either. The former New York City residents are allegedly on the outs with the city's elite social scene, with many influential New Yorkers telling The New York Times they can forget about ever returning to the Big Apple. As NYC socialite Jill Kargman told the publication:I have had visions of Ivanka with her thousand-dollar hair and makeup trying to show up at the opera like that and getting ejected. The poetic justice is that coming to New York would put them in a kind of prison already.However, shunning the couple could be a strategic decision made by some in an attempt to appear neutral in the typically Democratic state. A source told Vanity Fair:Everyone with self-respect, a career, morals, respect for democracy, or who doesn't want their friends to shame them both in private and public will steer clear.But the same insider notes they will likely be welcomed back by some - especially those who see the Trumps as their best chance at getting near to power. Another source added:They will probably be welcomed by real estate types and that group of Upper East Side and Palm Beach families that read about themselves. And even in that social scene, the source says:There will always be private dinner parties for them to attend, but they will be the entertainment.And while some may not be too pleased to see Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump strolling around the block when they eventually finish construction on their Billionaire's Bunker property, others seem less bothered. Even though Page Six notes their future home will take around two years to build, some locals have already been getting chummy with the Kushners. Noting that the residents on the island are largely Republican, an insider revealed:Ivanka and Jared had already been made to feel very welcome on the island. They had received numerous invitations to dine with their future neighbors.And hey, even if they don't manage to get into Indian Creek's Country Club — there's always the Trump-brand golf resort nearby.

From a young age, many said she looked more like Brad Pitt, and even during special events, instead of wearing a dress, she would dress like her father. To the majority, this is just someone who is a tomboy or looking up to her father. However, a lot of people speculated that Shiloh was actually transgender. This was a lot of media attention that the family did not necessarily appreciate. Though many celebrities like Amber Rose and Cher's son were in full support, Angelina came out and said though it could be a possibility, they believe their daughter should have the choice of what she wants to wear. With the support of the LGBTQ community, Shiloh's transgender rumor slowly moved into more support. Recently, the Brad/Angelina divorce has been a heavy topic.

Durde will be the Cowboys new Defensive Line Coach, apparently beating out Giff Smith for the job. Durde is young and the only British coach in the NFL, but it’s also another former Falcons coach joining the Cowboys. Aden Durde joins Joe Whitt as the hired coaches under Dan Quinn. Much like Whitt, Durde coached under Dan Quinn last season. He’s worked with the DL and LBs in Atlanta and was actually once a Cowboys intern in 2014. Now, he becomes the team’s DL coach. Cowboys News also mention another coaching update: Maurice Linguist, who likely wasn’t going to be back with the Cowboys, is heading to Michigan to be the Co-DC. Joe Whitt was hired last season by Dan Quinn to be the Atlanta Falcons secondary coach. Whitt is only 42-years old who worked under Mike McCarthy in Green Bay from 2008 to 2018.
