From a production standpoint, what do you do when the star of your TV show suddenly dies? Do you replace them with a different actor hoping that your audience won't notice or do you make up some kind of excuse that covers their absence and move on? This same scenario has played out over and over throughout the years leaving writing teams and producers scrambling to salvage their series. Like this content?

Other times, the series has to be scrapped entirely. In this video, we're going to take a look at some of the most famous cases of a TV show losing one of their stars and how they dealt with the problem. Hopefully, we'll also give these actors the respect that they deserve.

Second our caller was in a toxic relationship where she was putting up with behavior she should not be dealing with but also is being irrational in not listening to what her boyfriend is clearly telling her because of a fear of being alone. Next we speak with someone who is questioning getting engaged because she can’t figure out what the one thing is that keeps holding her back. Lastly we speak with a girl who felt rejected by someone she started to date and now that he is single again, and reaching out to her, she does not know if she should re-engage with him.  She shares with us her texts so that Nick can better understand the situation hearing both sides of the conversation. “ Its not hard for people to act like they are dating… what’s acting like we’re dating, its hanging out with someone while sex is on the table “Please make sure to subscribe so you don’t miss an episode and as always send in your relationship questions to asknick@kastmedia.com to be a part of our Monday episodes.
