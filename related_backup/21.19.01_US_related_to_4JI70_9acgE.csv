How you loved me and wadn’t nobody above me now it’s funny all the shit that you promised is just a memory.You gave me something to believe in then you broke me into pieces and it’s fucking with me mentally.And I can’t trust no other bitch because I’m starting to see woman as the enemy.I saw you texting with the dude and it was cool because you told me you and him were just friends Then I caught you in the bed, let it slide, took you back, and then you went and fucked the same dumb nigga again!What the fuck bitch? I gave my all to you.There’s a kid that no ones knows about and me and you both know that I’m the father too, that means I am apart of you, you went and broke my heart in two, then stabbed me in the back and watched me bleed pulled an pulled an audible.Fuck!How you think this gon end?Cause I been dealing with depression,Social media attentionThey expect me to be happy but I’m fucking depressed.Ye I swear I’m fucking depressed. All the money in the world don’t mean a thing if you can’t share it with somebody that you love and that you fucking respect.Do you know how it feels to be awake but all you want to do is go back to sleep because reality suffocating pushing on your chest so all you want to do is go and live your life in ya dreams?Do you know how it feels when the person that you love doesn’t love you back, when say the right things but their actions are opposite of everything they tell you everyday to relax?Bitch I would of killed for u!Man fuck all of this music I’d pass up on a deal for you!Other niggas tried to fuck I swear I only saw the real in you!You cheated twice!And now I can’t deal with you!It’s DaxDear God,I ask that you give me the strenght to trust again.

Remix after remix they all trash.. I hopped on the shit just to show em how bad they are at rapping long as i can.. Acceptance ain’t needed for me i got it.. It all come from me and myself and i and that’s why i don’t fiend for any alliance.. Now i see they all dreaming to be inside it.. I look at 16 me doing this.. Gave not a fuck about what you would do to him.. Long as he focused on him and improving it..  Balancing prosperity and influencing.. I just had to keep it going with it.. Then one day ill wake and be throne sitting.. Now I’m bone pickin.. Cause a lot of motherfuckers don’t be thankful for the people that’s growing with em.. Fuck you, everybody notice it but you.. Give back so the gram show love to.. Your manipulate game they dont know you.. I’m tryna collab w rappers.. But not with no stab you in the back rappers.. But a lot of em mad i can out rap em then sing the hook cause I’m passed rapping.. I drop gems more expensive than necklaces on they necks.. They told me i gotta problem with not knowing where i stand.. But they don’t know me like i do there’s so much more to who i am.. Fuck what they think ill do me i did enough listening to them.. Unapologetic with it.. Promise i wont ever let the product of this heaven sent gift i got to my head again.. I profit off of the thought of my knowledge being a medicine.. For the people that’s not where want to be but im there for them.. Cause dollars ain’t profit just something to keep my pockets a lil company.. This road can be lonely fuck quantity i need quality in my company ouu.. So much goes into this rap shit, but i make it happen.. Every day wake up and I be active, or this crashes.. Colleagues just rap when they not acting, and it’s tragic.. And this track only half of my reaction.. To what ive seen they all got bad scripts..I read in between lines.. Rappers all been some felines.. Bunch of pussy no rookie fucking em’ up since Iwas knee high.. With grass hoppers they hopping on trends watch em.. They got me they’ll say im doing that right now with this.. I just got so much to give honestly and it’s obvious I’m what they wake up working toward striving to be a copy of.. Damn. Lemme slow it down.. Opposite of how I’m coming up is where im bound.. Long as it my gut that i listen to and i pounce.. On everything it tell me to it never let me down.. I just breathe in, breathe out.. Everybody let me down.. Ouu.. Give thanks for the things i found.. In me when nobody was around.. Thank God for 2020 though.. Although covid gave me runny nose.. Also emptied out my fucking soul.. Now I’m starving growling like my tummy go.. Nah you funny bro.. You think im stupid im just dummy dope.. They be wave riding where the money floats.. I just take my cards how they handed to me and i flush em out like rummy goes.. It’s obvious what they be running from.. Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock AYE.. It ain’t over.. everybody know the game is over.. Fuck around and imma show you how a legend living ripping anything he flow on.. Seeing snakes in public so i keep my hood on gotta keep my cover like a King Cobra.. So i blend in, but i ain’t them.. Never that dont mistake it.. I could never just thinking about all the problems i know that brings them..Now you exposed.. I don’t even gotta get into they know.. I aint even tryna get into it they know.. Aw yeah they know yeah..I ain’t smoking but the flow aint sober it’s so fucking high.. Catch me laughing cause they reaching all they’ll ever do is try.. Im not hating i just hate how y’all dont know the things that i know.. Idols can be liars too.. Maybe im thinking too deep on it but no there’s something about it.. I’ll be the voice to expose all the noise of the game cause it’s clear that it’s crowded.. But I’m bout to blow i can count it up.. 1,2,3 and 4.. 5, 6, 7 ohh.. Chose my path and then i sprint.. Until i get to where i want cause thats just who i am.. Even if it’s slowly.. Even if it broke me yeah..Listen clear.. This is gonna be a different year.. Everything coming full circle for me and my mental, It’s time for the kid to steer.. Absorbed every conversation i had for the passed 3 years.. I’m tapped in with myself be open to what i have for the year..P.O.BOX: iamtherealak P.O.

Of all time. OG ManMan was a DMV rapper who decided to cross the line of the amount of disrespect you could fit into one song - and he unfortunately paid the price, which was his life. OG ManMan was found dead just 2 months of this music video being released. There's no direct correlation to this diss track being the reason why he got his life taken away - but if it was, would you be surprised? In this video I talk about the most disrespectful diss track I've ever seen.

As I mentioned AOC called for larger checks however now Ed Markey is calling once again for monthly checks!“The $1,400 in direct cash assistance is a down payment that will help families make rent, put food on the table, and pay the utility bills after Senate Republicans blocked that additional funding back in December,” Markey said Friday. “But we must still pass my legislation with Senator Bernie Sanders to provide $2,000 monthly payments to working people through the duration of the pandemic.”As you will recall in May of 2020, Markey, Sanders and now-Vice President-elect Kamala Harris introduced the Monthly Economic Crisis Support Act bill to provide monthly checks to most Americans. Individuals with incomes up to $100,000 would receive $2,000 a month. Those who file as head of household are eligible with annual incomes of up to $150,000. Married couples who make up to $200,000 would receive a combined $4,000 monthly. For families with children, they would receive $2,000 per child for up to three children.https://www.masslive.com/politics/2021/01/stimulus-check-update-sen-ed-markey-pushing-for-2000-monthly-payments-through-the-duration-of-covid-19-pandemic.htmlhttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/14/biden-wants-to-raise-stimulus-checks-to-2000-how-payments-will-work.htmlAs updates come out, I will be sure to share.
