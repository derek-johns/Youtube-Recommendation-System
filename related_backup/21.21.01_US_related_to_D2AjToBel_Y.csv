That sequel comes three years later in the form of Wonder Woman 1984, which in a historic first for a massive superhero blockbuster - came out on streaming at the same time as in theatres!Wonder Woman 1984 movie definitely raises some questions. Like why did Steve Trevor return through some random guy? Why are they using this man’s body for anything they like? Why is there a fully-fueled jet lying around at the Smithsonian and how does Steve Trevor know how to fly it? How does Diana know how to make it invisible? How did Wonder Woman get her lasso around Max Lord? How did literally everyone renounce their wishes? How did nobody wish the world to immediately end? What exactly is the message of this movie?!To answer all these questions and more, step inside the Pitch Meeting that led to Wonder Woman 1984!

I primarily make parody and critique videos. I use text edits or voice-overs as a form of commentary in each video to change it and make it funnier. The commentary adds to each video by giving my own opinion and perspective on the topic, and it can also be used to show different and funny expressions that I think a character would give at a particular moment. I also incorporate funny and unique memes into my videos to make them more transformative and creative.I've been making parodies more recently in the form of the Devoid of Logic and But It's full of Memes series. I strive to make all of my videos transformative and unique and include at least some form of commentary and funny material. Overall, each video contains well thought out jokes, commentary, memes, and edits. I try my hardest to put a lot of work into each video so you guys enjoy it :)","","D2AjToBel_Y"

At an Olympic themed games event she shows that she's far ahead of the adults and at one point dives off a platform in a way that's a clear callback to the film in which she did something similar.Not long after the character falls off her horse and she takes a shortcut in order to get ahead. It looks like there'll be no punishment for this but upon reaching the finish line she's disqualified from the race by her Aunt Antiope in a move that's certain to ruin Christmas.Now though seemingly disconnected from what's to come, this scene actually sets up a theme that is laced throughout the movie. From the introduction we get the idea that if one is willing to cheat and take shortcuts in order to get what they want then that will lead to them losing a lot in the long run and it reflects the general motif of the Dreamstone and Maxwell Lord.The Dreamstone is pretty much the Maguffin of the movie and juxtaposing Diana's lasso of truth, we learn that it's powered by lies. They do an excellent way of bringing the Beautiful Lies theme over from BVS in order to tie this film in with the greater universe and it's definitely one of the more intriguing plot devices in the DCEU. When holding it one can wish for what their heart desires, however it has a monkey's paw effect and though it gives whatever the bearer wants, it also takes something in return.Even the guy who just wishes for a Coffee burns his mouth.Lord gets it at one point in the film and his greed makes him wish to become it in what is the Comic Book Movie equivalent of 'I wish for a million wishes' or let me be a Genie.► Artist AttributionMusic By: KaizanBlu• Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/kaizanblu/• SoundCloud - https://soundcloud.com/kaizanblu/• Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/kaizanblumusic/• TikTok - @kaizanblu http://vm.tiktok.com/aCYwfx/• YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUtx...• DOWNLOAD @ https://www.chilloutmedia.com/kaizanbluLicence: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)- Full licence here: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...• Music released by: Chill Out Records @ https://goo.gl/fh3rEJ & https://www.LoFi-HipHop.com► Artist AttributionLofi Geek @Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3g16PgrLofi Geek Official Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyD59CI7beJDU493glZpxgAArtwork @mb0scoInstrumental by Homagehttps://youtu.be/cgTMK54xpL0","Welcome to the Heavy Spoilers show.You probably want to know a bit about me.As I was born the doctor walked in and said ‘Darth Vader is Luke’s father’Just as he was doing it he spilled a bunch of chemicals on meFused with my body and his words I became the SpoilermanEvery day Monday to Sunday we talk about the biggest spoilers in movies, tv shows, games and more!We've got a fantastic community here that's made up of hundreds of thousands of fantastic people just like you so if you wanna be in the know make sure you subscribe to the channelYou can check out our website here - https://deffinition.co.uk/Or follow us Twitter at - https://twitter.com/heavyspoilers","heavy spoilers spoilers marvel mcu ending explained movie breakdown everything you missed trailer breakdown video essay post credits scene film analysis ending scene everything explained deffinition phase 4 phase 5 black widow the eternals spiderman netflix movie review no spoilers non spoiler review trailer avengers marvel star wars the mandalorian what if avengers endgame spider man the batman the eternals morbius avengers falcon and winter soldier mandalorian wandavision batman the batman joker dc dceu lovecraft country dc fandome","D2AjToBel_Y"

And what does it have to do with the studio's subsequently-announced multiverse-expanding (yet somehow still mostly Batman-oriented...) most recent change-of-direction for the endlessly-troubled DCEU megafranchise?In the first of two parts, THE BIG PICTURE explores what went wrong enough to cause arguably the most highly-anticipated actually-released movie of 2020 to also be among the most widely derided. #WonderWoman1984 #DCEU #TheBatman","The channel for MovieBob and The Game OverThinker","","D2AjToBel_Y"

Complicating the already daunting job of raising two boys, Clark and Lois must also concern themselves with whether or not their sons Jonathan (Jordan Elsass, “Little Fires Everywhere”) and Jordan (Alexander Garfin, “The Peanuts Movie”) could inherit their father’s Kryptonian superpowers as they grow older. Returning to Smallville to handle some Kent family business, Clark and Lois are reacquainted with Lana Lang (Emmanuelle Chriqui, “Entourage”), a local loan officer who also happens to be Clark’s first love, and her Fire Chief husband Kyle Cushing (Erik Valdez, “Graceland”). The adults aren’t the only ones rediscovering old friendships in Smallville as the Kent sons are reacquainted with Lana and Kyle’s rebellious daughter, Sarah (Inde Navarrette, “Wander Darkly”). Of course, there’s never a dull moment in the life of a superhero, especially with Lois’ father, General Samuel Lane (Dylan Walsh, “Nip/Tuck”) looking for Superman to vanquish a villain or save the day at a moment’s notice. Meanwhile, Superman and Lois’ return to idyllic Smallville is set to be upended when a mysterious stranger (Wolé Parks, “All American”) enters their lives.

McConnell decried the move to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement, cancel the Keystone XL pipeline and put a hold on many Trump immigration policies.There's still plenty of time for President Biden to remember that he does not owe his election to the far left, McConnell said. The president can and should refocus his administration on creating good paying American jobs, not sacrificing our people's livelihoods to liberal symbolism.Subscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2TwO8GmBloomberg Quicktake brings you live global news and original shows spanning business, technology, politics and culture.
