If there’s a good part thenI hope it’s not far ‘causeI thought it’d be today I napped on campus andI smoked at dancesBut it didn’t feel so great If you put this scene on a movie screenIs it called a happy end?If the work gets me where I’m supposed to beWill I know I’ve made it then?

In 2013, the trio released their debut independent single, I'm Ready. Well-received, the track peaked at number 27 on the Billboard's Top 40, and appeared the band's 2015 full-length debut album, Living Room. Since then, AJR released 2 full length albums, The Click (2017) and Neotheater (2019) featuring hit singles, Weak, Sober Up, and 100 Bad Days. AJR spent much of 2019 touring and eventually returned in 2020 with the bombastic pop single Bang!","AJR AJR Brothers The Click Band Music","Ew8jKnliFZg"

Without further delay, here is Rumour Roundup…Link to poll: https://www.youtube.com/post/UgxwzO8VbjYwwZMEQ0d4AaABCQ0:21 - Hamilton Allegedly Does Not Want Russell As His Teammate2:00 - Rapid RumoursWilliams driver George Russell’s impressive showing during the Sakhir GP last year when he got the one-off chance to drive for Mercedes has led to suggestions that it won’t be long before he gets to drive full-time for the team. However, the latest rumors suggest that he might face some obstacles in the form of the ongoing contract negotiations between the team and their star driver Lewis Hamilton.I'm your host Dillon Shelley and first up on Rumour Round-Up:Hamilton Allegedly Does Not Want Russell As His TeammateWhile a few of the earlier rumors had suggested that there were a few sticking points with regards to Hamilton’s demands that Mercedes aren’t happy to comply with, one more point might have been added to that listApparently, Lewis Hamilton wants to add a clause that will require his consent when it comes to selecting his teammateThe reason being suggested is that Hamilton is seemingly very comfortable with the team dynamics he has with current teammate Valtteri BottasHamilton may feel that a young gun like George Russell who has already shown that he can do well in a Mercedes would offer him stiffer competition which would put his place in the team and his negotiating power in the future in jeopardyMercedes supposedly do not want to give in to this demand as they feel that after what would be three years at the end of 2021 with Williams, Russell would be looking to move forward and if Mercedes aren’t able to accommodate him, other teams might lure him awayMercedes do not want to do that given that they have a lot of time and resources invested in Russell and their junior program’s pool of drivers is quite shallow on experienceAll of this seems to suggest that the contract negotiations between Hamilton and Mercedes will involve navigating quite a few roadblocks before an official announcement can be madeRapid RumorsThe upcoming Fiat-Peugeot merger could put Alfa Romeo’s future in F1 in jeopardy especially given the team’s track record in F1 that has seen them mostly relegated to the back of the fieldMercedes are apparently looking to sign 19-year-old Frederik Vesti, a Danish driver to bolster their young drivers’ programAlpine are purportedly hard at work to come up with an attractive new livery after their winter livery received a lot of negative reactions on social mediaThe Australian GP’s position on the calendar could undergo further changes as some of the organizers are still unsure about the November slotRich Energy, who tried and failed to sponsor Haas are seemingly looking to make a return to F1 in 2021Fans will reportedly have to wait until the end of February to find out if the Portuguese GP will be a part of the 2021 calendarThere are rumors that some of the races scheduled for street circuits such as Monaco, Montreal, and Baku won’t go aheadCertain people in the Aston Martin camp supposedly aren’t too happy with the fact that their new F1 factory is still 18 months away from being completedThis nervousness has further been compounded by suspected fears that new signing Sebastian Vettel might not be able to live up to the lofty expectations people have for himValtteri Bottas is supposedly already contemplating retirement at the end of 2021 as he feels Mercedes won’t extend his contract any further unless Lewis Hamilton forces them toHas Lewis Hamilton earned the right to a veto for future potential teammate signings?","Welcome to Formula World!

As a blacksmith, most of the projects start as lumps of steel, or stacks of different alloys for making damascus, that I forge out into blades, sculpture, art or tools before taking the project to the machining equipment or into the grinding room for finishing. Each project teaches me a lot and stretches the bounds of my knowledge. I make a lot of mistakes but they serve as an excellent teacher. There's always something important for me to learn in the shop! I want my work to be the spark that ignites the desire for you to get into your shop (or kitchen/basement/garage) and make something too! Whether it's stitching a leather wallet or forging a giant sword, you'll love the creative process.Be sure to follow me on instagram @alecsteele for behind the scenes and grab some awesome products at https://alecsteeleshop.com/Thanks!
