They included Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, Kansas Sen. Roger Marshall, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville, among hundreds other congress members.At the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, we continuously evaluate our political contributions to ensure that those we support share our values and goals, said Kim Keck, BlueCross BlueShield's president and CEO, in a statement. In light of this week's violent, shocking assault on the United States Capitol, and the votes of some members of Congress to subvert the results of November's election by challenging Electoral College results, BCBSA will suspend contributions to those lawmakers who voted to undermine our democracy.The health insurance company's BLUEPAC political action committee -- supported only by employee contributions -- donated $246,750 to Republican lawmakers during the 2020 cycle. That included $10,000 to Sen. Tuberville, $1,000 to Sen. Marshall and $500 to Sen.

There are unverified accusations of a reconnaissance mission one day before the attack. And more than a dozen US Capitol Police officers are under internal investigation for allegedly helping rioters.While President Donald Trump's role in inciting the violence is clear, there are some early indications and accusations that other insiders may have more actively aided the mob.Ali Alexander, a right-wing conspiracy theorist who led one of the Stop The Steal groups, claimed in a livestream video that he planned the rally that preceded the riot with three GOP lawmakers: Reps. Paul Gosar and Andy Biggs of Arizona, and Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama.Brooks spoke at the rally before Trump took the stage, and urged the crowd to start taking down names and kicking ass. In a 2,800-word statement about his involvement, Brooks said he was only telling the crowd to fight back at the ballot box. (Brooks also revealed that a White House official called him one day earlier and invited him to speak at the rally.)CNN previously reported that Gosar associated himself with Alexander's group in recent months. A spokesman for Biggs told CNN that he hasn't ever met or worked with Alexander.Alexander said he hoped his mob would pressure lawmakers to block President-elect Joe Biden's victory through the Electoral College. After the riot was quelled, the three lawmakers voted to throw out Biden's electoral votes from Arizona and Pennsylvania. Their effort failed.#CNN #News","CNN operates as a division of Turner Broadcasting System, which is a subsidiary of Warner Media.

The Democratic lawmaker said that the House will try to pass legislation on Monday urging Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment and declare the president incapable of executing the duties of his office. If that fails — which is considered the most likely outcome — Pelosi said that the House would move ahead with impeachment proceedings, although she did not say when that would be. In protecting our Constitution and our Democracy, we will act with urgency, because this President represents an imminent threat to both,'' the House speaker said.Trump, who is scheduled to leave office on January 20, has received sharp criticism following the violence in and around the US Capitol building on Wednesday. Trump has been accused of inciting the violence, by addressing a large rally on the National Mall in front of the US Capitol, saying he would join them when they walk down to the Capitol earlier that day. Since losing the Nov. 3 election, Trump has falsely claimed he was the victim of widespread fraud. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told American broadcaster CBS in an interview that will air Sunday that the person that's running the executive branch is a deranged, unhinged, dangerous president of the United States.   Trump was previously impeached under two articles: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress in regards to allegations that Trump sought to discredit then-Democratic candidate Joe Biden in the lead up to the 2020 US presidential election. The articles were written up in 2019 and the trial was held in January 2020.The Republican-controlled Senate did not find him guilty of either article. A two-thirds majority is required for a conviction.Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1For more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/Follow DW on social media:►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnewsFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/channel/deutschewelle#DonaldTrump #NancyPelosi #Impeachment","Journalism that’s Made for Minds.

When asked about whether he bears responsibility for the violence, the president said his remarks at a rally proceeding the storming of the building were totally appropriate. They've analyzed my speech in my words and my final paragraph, my final sentence, and everybody to the tee just thought it was totally appropriate, the president said prior to a trip to Texas.His remarks to reporters on Tuesday were the first he's delivered since a mob of his supporters stormed the US Capitol last week, leaving five dead. Trump also hit back at the latest bid to impeach him — this time for inciting last week's violence. To continue on this path, I think it's causing tremendous danger to our country, and it's causing tremendous anger, he said, adding: I want no violence. He also voiced anger at Big Tech companies after Twitter and Facebook banned him on their platforms for encouraging violence.He said the companies had made a terrible mistake, accusing them of dividing the country.Meanwhile US Vice President Mike Pence said in a letter to Democrat House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday that he would not invoke the 25th amendment. The House of Representatives, controlled by Democrats, rushed a vote on a resolution urging the vice president to use the powers in the amendment to remove Donald Trump from power in the wake of the violent attack on the Capitol building on January 6.German lender Deutsche Bank is abandoning its longtime client, US President Donald Trump. Citing sources familiar with the matter, US media on Tuesday reported that the bank would do no further business with the self-styled businessman, pointing to his reaction to the January 6 assault on the US Capitol. That the president's long-term lender would drop him now comes as little surprise. Even before the November election, Deutsche Bank senior officials had said the company was seeking a way out of its long-term relationship with the contentious leader, who owes the institute hundreds of millions in loans and has been a constant source of bad press for the bank. In recent days, financial institutions Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co. as well as others have announced they are cutting business ties or halting political donations in light of recent events. Some have said they will freeze donations to the Republican lawmakers who voted against certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election. Others say they will temporarily stop political contributions to both Republicans and Democrats. This sudden jumping ship has pulled the curtain back on the role corporate leadership and money play in the US political machine.Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1For more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/Follow DW on social media:►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnewsFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/channel/deutschewelle#DonaldTrump #Impeachment #DeutscheBank","Journalism that’s Made for Minds.

Mayor Muriel Bowser has called in the National Guard ahead of the protests, after anti-democracy protesters clashed with police near Black Lives Matter Plaza. Police arrested six people on charges that include bringing illegal guns to the city. National security reporter William Arkin says it is “an unprecedented moment,” with the sitting president actively encouraging the unrest. We also speak with Jason Wilson, an investigative journalist who tracks the political right and extremist movements, who says the Trump presidency has seen a startling merger of the GOP with the far right. “There’s not really a sharp dividing line between violent, far-right street activists and the supporters of the president in Congress,” says Wilson.#DemocracyNowDemocracy Now! is an independent global news hour that airs on nearly 1,400 TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.

Many churches have requested extra protection, and the Metropolitan AME Church is suing the Proud Boys. Sadly, our nation has a very dark and sordid history of targeting historically Black churches, says Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, who represents the church in its lawsuit. We will use civil rights law as a way of sending a message to extremists that they are not above the law and will be held accountable for their dangerous, toxic and dark actions. #DemocracyNowDemocracy Now! is an independent global news hour that airs on nearly 1,400 TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.

He is the first of Michigan’s 49 governors in 184 years to face charges related to their time in office. If convicted, he could face up to one year in jail and up to $1,000 in fines. Snyder is among nine senior officials who are facing a total of 42 criminal charges for their actions that caused a deadly Legionnaires’ disease outbreak in Genesee County, and caused permanent, irreversible brain damage due to lead poisoning to thousands of Flint children.Michael is joined by investigative journalist Jordan Chariton who had doggedly reported on the plight of the people of Flint and the wide-ranging cover-up by Snyder and his henchman. They discuss why it's taken this long for any sort of legal action to be taken against Snyder, why his misdemeanor charge is not enough, and what we must do now.How A Flurry Of Suspicious Phone Calls Set Investigators On Rick Snyder’s TrailBy Jordan Chariton & Jenn Dizehttps://theintercept.com/2021/01/13/flint-michigan-rick-snyder-legionnaires/Michigan's Ex-Gov.
