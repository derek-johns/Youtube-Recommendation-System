Run The Jewels at https://DJShadow.lnk.to/TMWFNSPre-Order DJ Shadow's New Album - Our Pathetic Age - http://smarturl.it/opastoreDJ Shadow has unveiled the music video for the song “Nobody Speak” featuring Run The Jewels, a standout track from his album ‘The Mountain Will Fall,’ out now on Mass Appeal Records.  The video depicts a meeting of leaders that quickly descends into chaos, a scene not unlike what is unfolding in governments around the globe.  It also features appearances by DJ Shadow and Run The Jewels. Says DJ Shadow: We wanted to make a positive, life-affirming video that captures politicians at their election-year best.  We got this instead.” Says Run The Jewels’ Killer Mike: It's such a dope video. It's what I really wish Trump and Hillary would just do and get it over with...And even in that fight I think Hillary would win - and that's not an endorsement. The video was directed by Sam Pilling and produced by Pulse Films, stars Igor Tsyshkevych and Ian Bailey, and was shot in NYC, London and Ukraine.

The album was released in June to rave reviews, a performance with Run The Jewels on The Tonight Show, and a #1 iTunes electronic chart debut in 16 countries, including DJ Shadow’s first #1 on Billboard's Dance / Electronic chart in U.S.   The Mountain Will Fall is available in physical and digital formats and is available here - https://DJShadow.lnk.to/TMWFNS In advance of his album release, he hosted another classic Essential Mix for the BBC and also did a pop-up show with Beats1 called #Radioface, with more to follow later this year.  Raves for ‘The Mountain Will Fall’: “Impressive in its inventiveness” – The Guardian “Rolling and meditative” – Vice Noisey “Brassy and bruising” – Rolling Stone An album that bridges eras to envision what the future may hold” - Boston Globe “This is DJ Shadow’s best work since his early-aughts heyday.

When El-P and Killer Mike strode in with their usual uniforms — Mike in a gold chain as thick as a garter snake, El in a fitted Yankees cap and pair of blue-mirrored sunglasses — the two didn't have to do as much as nod to one another before upending three tracks from their latest LP, RTJ3, in strange and perfect symbiosis.El-P (née El-Producto, née Jaime Meline) — rapper, producer, and all-around godfather of the backpacker scene of the late-90's — and Killer Mike — known for guest features on tracks by Atlanta's Dungeon Family in the early-aughts, solo work in the mid-to-late '00s, and perhaps most widely for his very public support of Senator Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign last year — have out-mused each other in a supergroup that somehow seems to get better, louder, and more pertinent since their start in 2013. They represent an ideal evolution of underground hip-hop to mainstream success, mixing a fundamentally activist animus with IMAX-level production without losing a speck of vital force.On an unseasonably beautiful day in D.C., Run the Jewels was sweaty and sulfuric, ad-libbing with one another in an exchange so slick, easy, and conspiratorial, it felt like we were in on their shared language.Run the Jewels 3 is available now:iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/run-the-jewels-3/id1186541961Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/Run-Jewels-3/dp/B01MRSRJS7SET LISTTalk To MeLegend Has ItA Report To The ShareholdersMUSICIANSKiller Mike (vocals); EL-P (vocals); Trackstar the DJ (DJ)CREDITSProducers: Abby O'Neill, Niki Walker; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Niki Walker, Nick Michael, Morgan Noelle Smith; Production Assistant: A Noah Harrison; Photo: Claire Harbage/NPR.For more Tiny Desk concerts, subscribe to our podcast: http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510292/tiny-desk-concerts-video","The official YouTube channel for NPR Music featuring Tiny Desk Concerts, live shows, documentaries and more.

I felt a sense of responsibility to do just that. We had to exploit the lyrics and aggression and emotion of the track, and translate that into a film that would ignite a valuable and productive conversation about racially motivated violence in this country. It's provocative, and we all knew this, so we were tasked with making something that expressed the intensity of senseless violence without eclipsing our humanity. For me, it was important to write a story that didn’t paint a simplistic portrait of the characters of the Cop and Kid. They're not stereotypes. They're people - complex, real people and, as such, the power had to shift between them at certain points throughout the story. The film begins and it feels like they have been fighting for days, they’re exhausted, not a single punch is thrown, their violence is communicated through clumsy, raw emotion. They've already fought their way past their judgments and learned hatred toward one another.  Our goal was to highlight the futility of the violence, not celebrate it.” For El-P of Run the Jewels “this is a vision of a seemingly never-ending struggle whose participants are pitted against each other by forces originating outside of themselves.”  Adds partner Killer Mike this video represents the futile and exhausting existence of a purgatory-like law enforcement system. There is no neat solution at the end because there is no neat solution in the real world. However, there is an opportunity to dialogue and change the way communities are policed in this country. Salutes to AG Rojas for his unique take on the subject matter and to Shea and Keith for giving us their all and bringing it to life.DIRECTED BY A.G.

Mike came roaring outta the ATL in 2000 when he dropped head-spinning verses on “Snappin' & Trappin' ” on OutKast's 'Stankonia' and made his solo debut with 'Monster' in 2003. Meanwhile, in Brooklyn, El-P co-founded the Definitive Jux label and produced their breakout artists, including Aesop Rock and RJD2. Fast-forward to 2012, when El-P produced Mike's 'R.A.P. Music' and Mike was featured on El-P's 'Cancer 4 Cure'; they toured together and then bonded as Run The Jewels. The impromptu partnership has evolved into a potent project, yielding three albums bursting with passion, political outrage, and wry doses of humor. RTJ's relentless flow is backed by deep beats from Trackstar the DJ and has featured a dizzying array of guest appearances from Zack de la Rocha, Kamasi Washington, and Danny Brown. We caught up with the guys in “The World According To Run The Jewels,” where they weighed in on cagey investments, romantic relationships, North Korean haircuts, strippers, weed, and the never-ending process of physical fitness.

Your favorite rapper's favorite rapper. DOOM is a British-American rapper. He performed and released music under several stage names, most notably MF Doom (stylized in all caps). DOOM debuted during hip hop's golden age of the late 1980s and became a major figure in underground hip hop of the early 21st century. Upon his death, Variety called him one of the most celebrated, unpredictable and enigmatic figures in independent hip-hop. People have called him The Phantom of the Opera of Hip Hop.Born in London, Dumile moved with his family to Long Island, New York, at a young age. He began his musical career in 1988 as a member of the trio KMD, performing under the name Zev Love X with his younger brother DJ Subroc and another MC called Rodan. After hearing about the group from 3rd Bass, A&R Dante Ross signed KMD to Elektra Records and their recording debut arrived on 3rd Bass’s song “The Gas Face” from The Cactus Album. Their debut album Mr. Hood was released in 1991 and attained modest success with the singles “Peachfuzz” and “Who Me?” KMD disbanded in 1993. After taking a hiatus from music, Dumile reemerged in 1998, when he began performing at open mic events while wearing a mask. He adopted the MF Doom persona and rarely made unmasked public appearances thereafter. His metal mask resembles that of Marvel Comics super-villain Doctor Doom, who is depicted rapping on the cover of his 1999 debut solo album Operation: Doomsday. DOOM’s most prolific period was in the early 2000s, when he released four studio albums and two collaborative albums between 2003 and 2005, using the MF Doom moniker as well as the pseudonyms King Geedorah and Viktor Vaughn. In the 2010s, he relocated to London, where he recorded more music.MF DOOM frequently collaborated with other producers and rappers, most notably Madlib, under the moniker Madvillain. The duo's 2004 album Madvillainy received widespread critical acclaim upon its release and has been cited as DOOM’s magnum opus and a landmark album in hip hop. DOOM’s other notable collaborations include Danger Doom (with Danger Mouse), Doomstarks (with Ghostface Killah), JJ Doom (with Jneiro Jarel), NehruvianDoom (with Bishop Nehru), and Czarface Meets Metal Face (with Czarface).In 2003, MF DOOM released the King Geedorah album Take Me to Your Leader. Geedorah is credited as producer, but only appears as an MC on four tracks. The majority of vocal tracks feature guest MCs, and the album features several instrumental montages of sampled vocals from old movies and TV shows—a technique employed on most of Doom’s albums. Later in 2003, DOOM released the LP Vaudeville Villain under the moniker Viktor Vaughn (another play on Doctor Doom, whose real name is Victor von Doom). In 2004 he released a follow-up LP under the Viktor Vaughn moniker, Venomous Villain. Later in 2004, the second MF Doom album Mm..Food was released by Minnesota-based label Rhymesayers Entertainment.DOOM’s first commercial breakthrough came in 2004, with the album Madvillainy, created with producer Madlib under the group name Madvillain. Released by Stones Throw Records, the album was a critical and commercial success. It has since become known as a MF DOOM masterpiece.BeatGrade is a music news source and media website for discovering talent and sharing music. New videos added weekly to our channel.

Anthony Fantano here...again! Cause it turns out the Internet's busiest music nerd is too busy for just one channel dedicated to music.

We’ll be presenting Phish’s first New Year’s Eve show from Madison Square Garden — 12/31/95 — in its entirety, beginning at 8:30 pm ET.We’ve teamed up with the fine folks at https://Chess.com to host the Band vs. Audience online chess game which will start right at the top of the show and move at a decent clip. In short, fans will have 5 minutes to move their piece (the band will have no more than that as well). At the end of 5 minutes, whichever move has the most votes is the ‘audience’ move. Stick around during the set breaks as the band joins in from their various homes, playing a few moves and providing scintillating commentary on the game. We will post and send out the actual game link on 12/31.To pace yourself over a long evening, we present some chess cheese board recipes for extended grazing. Our friend Marissa Mullen put together two options — “Olive Cheese Dreams” and “Billy Bries” — with an easy ‘cheese by numbers’ guide. Feel free to swap out any of the ingredients if there’s something else you prefer. Pair with the bubbly of your choice. For dessert, chessboard cookies! Recipes can be found at https://livephi.sh/chessmenuFor this final webcast of the year, our beneficiary will be none other than The WaterWheel Foundation itself. Since 1997, the band and their fans have collaborated on a nationwide charitable endeavor by raising funds and donating the proceeds across the country. This year alone, collectively we have raised and donated nearly $750,000 to 27 different nonprofits during the Dinner And A Movie series. Join us in continuing to support those in need.
