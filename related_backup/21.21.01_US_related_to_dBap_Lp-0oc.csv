I hope this video gives an idea of phase space - a picture of dynamical systems in which each point completely represents the state of the system. For a pendulum, phase space is only 2-dimensional and you can get orbits (in the case of an undamped pendulum) or an inward spiral (in the case of a pendulum with friction). For the Lorenz equations we need three dimensions to show the phase space. The attractor you find for these equations is said to be strange and chaotic because there is no loop, only infinite curves that never intersect. This explains why the motion is so unpredictable - two different initial conditions that are very close together can end up arbitrarily far apart.Music from https://epidemicsound.com The Longest Rest A Sound Foundation Seaweed","An element of truth - videos about science, education, and anything else I find interesting.","science videos science science education science literacy veritasium misconceptions physics education astronomy science songs chemistry biology teaching learning","dBap_Lp-0oc"

To me this sounded like unsubstantiated rubbish, like the claim the Great Wall is the only manmade structure visible from space. So I put my own psyche on the line, subjecting myself to over an hour of the most intense quiet on Earth. No, this was not THE quietest room on Earth (-9dB) but it is one of the quietest, and the truth is once you put a person inside, they are by far the loudest thing in there so the sound rating of the room is irrelevant.I was not surprised to find that I could stay in there for as long as I liked and feel perfectly fine. What was surprising is that my heartbeat was audible. You can hear it on the sound recording. Now I wasn't consciously aware of the sound of my heart while in the room, but I was more aware of the feeling of it beating.Huge thank you to everyone at BYU: Duane Merrell, Spencer Perry, Cameron Vongsawad, Jazz Myers, Ann Clawson, and Robert Willes.","An element of truth - videos about science, education, and anything else I find interesting.","science videos science science education science literacy veritasium misconceptions physics education astronomy science songs chemistry biology teaching learning","dBap_Lp-0oc"

We can use the Schrödinger equation to solve for and evolve wave functions. Then we invoke wave-particle duality, in essence things we detect as particles can behave as waves when they aren't interacting with anything. But when there is a measurement, the wave function collapses leaving us with a definite particle detection. If we repeat the experiment many times, we find the statistics of these results mirror the amplitude of the wave function squared. Hence the Born rule came into being, saying the wave function should be interpreted statistically, that our universe at the most fundamental scale is probabilistic rather than deterministic. This did not sit well with scientists like Einstein and Schrödinger who believed there must be more going on, perhaps 'hidden variables'.In the 1950's Hugh Everett proposed the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. It is so logical in hindsight but with a bias towards the classical world, experiments and measurements to guide their thinking, it's understandable why the founders of quantum theory didn't come up with it. Rather than proposing different dynamics for measurement, Everett suggests that measurement is something that happens naturally in the course of quantum particles interacting with each other. The conclusion is inescapable. There is nothing special about measurement, it is just the observer becoming entangled with a wave function in a superposition. Since one observer can experience only their own branch, it appears as if the other possibilities have disappeared but in reality there is no reason why they could not still exist and just fail to interact with the other branches. This is caused by environmental decoherence.Schrodinger's cat animation by Iván TelloWave functions, double slit and entanglement animation by Jonny HymanFilming of opening sequence by Casey RentzSpecial thanks to Mithuna Y, Raquel Nuno and Dianna Cowern for feedback on the scriptMusic from https://epidemicsound.com Experimental 1 Serene Story 2 Seaweed Colorful Animation 4","An element of truth - videos about science, education, and anything else I find interesting.","science videos science science education science literacy veritasium misconceptions physics education astronomy science songs chemistry biology teaching learning","dBap_Lp-0oc"

You could say that it is central control, or headquarters for our body. Without our brain, we are not alive. The brain is where our consciousness lives and our memories are preserved. If we are considered “brain dead”, then the plug gets pulled on our life support. It is a complex organ of fatty tissue, and the brain helps us process different kinds of information through our five sense. Using our nose, the brain can tell us whether we are experiencing a pleasant smell or something foul. With our ears, the brain can help us process the noises we are hearing and be able to tell the difference from language to noises. With our mouth, the brain helps us figure out whether the food we are eating is good for us and not poisonous. Finally, with our eyes, the brain helps us process the information we are seeing visually. Our brain and our eyes have a beautiful relationship by letting us see colors, nature, people, and more, along with associate these visions with emotions. With such wondrous capabilities, it can be easy to just assume and trust that what our eyes are telling us is true. Well, not exactly. In the last several centuries, optical illusions have been playing tricks with our brain and causing us to question what is real and what is fiction. Optical illusions can be created by Mother Nature, or they can be manmade, thus creating an entire art dedication to optical illusions and messing with our brain and everything that we know about the world around us. With the innovation and evolution of optical illusions, we are now getting confused more often than ever before! People have even dedicated their lives and support themselves from creating their own optical illusions. These artists even get a kick from us stepping on their painting and thinking that we are about to descend into a multiple story fall, but instead, our foot remains on solid ground.This video has ten of the most mind blowing optical illusions. They are so crazy that you would think that they were simply a trick of the camera or computer. What makes these optical illusions extra special is the fact that they play with your perception using colors, angles, light, shapes, sizes, and more. Our eyes have been conditioned and groomed to see certain things by the way the light hits an object, or by the way and angle is seen by our eyes. Reality can be manipulated so many ways by a simple tilt of the head or a beam of light, or a splash of color. By breaking down why you are seeing the optical illusion in the first place, we can start descending upon the bridge of understanding. Probably one of the most unsettling things about optical illusions is that the seed of doubt can bleed over to our normal everyday lives and cause us to question everything by just looking outside.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheRichest.orgTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheRichest_ComInstagram: http://instagram.com/therichest-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Featuring:FLAT 3RD DIMENSIONFOLLOWING EYES BACKWARDS  CHAIRDROP OFF ROOMANIMATION ILLUSIONTHE AMES ROOMMOTION ILLUSIONSCIRCLE ILLUSIONYES-NOTHE DRESS-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Music Track:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more videos and articles visit:http://www.therichest.com/","TheRichest is the channel made to watch videos of unbelievable but amazing facts about the most interesting people on earth!Wether you want to learn about the lifestyle of famous celebrities, how they spend their millions, the most expensive things in the world, secret military technology, money topics and even some of the strangest discoveries - we've got you covered.You can expect at least 1 video every day to fill your daily dose of internet brain food -and you know we'll always provide you with the richest quality on YouTube.For business related matters relating to our channel (including media & advertising) please contact business.yt@valnetinc.comFor copyright matters relating to our channel please contact us directly at : legal@valnetinc.com","Amazing Facts Educational athlete Interesting Science Famous People Places money mind blowing facts therichest","dBap_Lp-0oc"

The footage is amazing! https://www.flir.comAerogel’s extraordinary properties are due in large part to its structure. Aerogel is a solid but on the nanoscale it has a mesh or sponge-like structure. The struts of this structure are nanoscale, as are the pores at around 20nm across. This makes silica aerogel incredibly light (it was once the lightest solid but has now been superseded by graphene aerogel), transparent and adsorbent. An ice-cube sized piece of aerogel has an internal surface area roughly equal to half a football field. Aerogel is used in high end museum cases to regulate humidity. Plus it helps maintain the vacuum on the Mars Insight seismometers - it adsorbs moisture and other outgassed volatiles that come from the spacecraft itself. Proposed uses include as a physical insecticide by ‘drying out insects’ reducing the need for chemical and toxic pesticides.Special thanks to all my Patreon supporters especially those who contributed feedback to an earlier draft of this video:a human, Albert Jachowicz-Brzeziński, Alfred Wallace, Arjun Chakroborty, Brent Stewart, Chris Vargas, Chuck Lauer Vose, Clip Tree, Coale Shifflett, Colin Bellmore, DALE HORNE, Eric Velazquez, Fedor Indutny, Fran Rodriguez, James Wong, Jasper Xin, Joar Wandborg, Johnny, Jorge Angel Sandoval, June Kang, Kevin Beavers, Kishore Tipirneni, Levan Ferr, Listen Money Matters, Manuel Zürcher, Mark Bevilacqua, Mathias Göransson, Michael Bradley Wirz, Michael Krugman, Mohammed Al Sahaf, Nicholas Hastings, OddJosh, Patrick Čalija, Peter Tajti, Philipp Volgger, Roberto Rezende, Robin DeBank, Ron Neal, Stan Presolski, Swante Scholz, Tiago Bruno, Tige Thorman, Warrior8252Filmed by Paul GramagliaThumbnail by Ignat BerbeciAnimations by Catherine ChooljianMusic from https://epidemicsound.com “Tonic Zone” “Betelgeuse” “Insidious Mice” “Seaweed” “It’s not that serious” “Platin00m - Sum It”This is an educational, scientific video.","An element of truth - videos about science, education, and anything else I find interesting.","science videos science science education science literacy veritasium misconceptions physics education astronomy science songs chemistry biology teaching learning","dBap_Lp-0oc"

But, we are here not to discuss her artistic skills.- The name of this illusion was inspired by a tiled wall of a café in Bristol. But I will tell you no more for now. Can you tell if the dark lines are parallel to each other or inclined?- The impossible triangle, also known as Penrose Triangle is called so because it could never exist in reality. If it did exist, it would be absolutely contrary to the rules of Euclidean geometry.- What makes the bicycle move? Obviously, the fact that the spokes in its wheels are rotating. Nah, it can’t be that easy when it comes to optical illusions.- It’s a Rubik’s cube! This optical illusion is based on anamorphosis. It is a form of perspective.- You can’t play any chess with this board because it’s moving all over the place. Or is it? You have 15 seconds to decide if the lines are rotating.- Can you tell what’s wrong with Steve Buscemi?

In fact, this is a strict inequality - if the energy is highest possible, there are no other possible combinations of momenta other than L2=L3=0, and vice versa for if the energy is the lowest possible.Because of this, in the case of axis 1 the energy is so high that there simply aren't any other possible combinations of angular momentum components L1, L2 and L3 - the object would have to lose energy in order to spin differently. And in the case of axis 3, the energy is so low that there likewise is no way for the object to be rotating other than purely around axis 3 - it would have to gain energy. However, there's no such constraint for axis 2, since the energy is somewhere in between the min and max possible. This, together with the centrifugal effects, means that the components of momentum DO change.","An element of truth - videos about science, education, and anything else I find interesting.","science videos science science education science literacy veritasium misconceptions physics education astronomy science songs chemistry biology teaching learning","dBap_Lp-0oc"

The first time I heard about shade balls the claim was they reduce evaporation. But it turns out this isn't the reason they were introduced.Huge thanks to LADWP for arranging this special tour for me. Next time let's put the GoPro on the submersible!The balls are made of high density polyethylene (HDPE) which is less dense than water so they float on the surface of the reservoir even if they break apart. They are 10cm (4 inches) in diameter and contain about 210ml of water. So the main reason they are on the reservoir is to block sunlight from entering the water and triggering a chemical reaction that turns harmless bromide into carcinogenic bromate. This effect occurs with prolonged exposure to bromate so regulators insist that levels be kept below 10 microgram per liter on average over a 12 month period.Special thanks to Patreon supporters:Donal Botkin, Michael Krugman, Ron Neal, Stan Presolski, Terrance Shepherd, Penward Rhyme and everyone who provided feedback on an early draft of this video.Thanks to:Las Virgenes Reservoir for footage of initial shade ball dumpEuro-Matic for bird into jet-engine footageResearched and Produced by Casey RentzAnimations by Maria RaykovaMusic from http://epidemicsound.com Colorful Animation 4 SeaweedAnd from Kevin MacLeod Marty Gots a PlanThis is an educational video about the science of water quality.","An element of truth - videos about science, education, and anything else I find interesting.","science videos science science education science literacy veritasium misconceptions physics education astronomy science songs chemistry biology teaching learning","dBap_Lp-0oc"

This is why there is some controversy around using the term 'virtual particles'. Some people think the term is useful, especially since in calculating with Feynman diagrams you draw all the particle interactions that are possible (and then do the calculations to get the right answer).

It will be broadcast in mid-2015, details to come. The filming took me to the most radioactive places on Earth (and some places, which surprisingly aren't as radioactive as you'd think). Chernobyl and Fukushima were incredible to see as they present post-apocalyptic landscapes. I also visited nuclear power plants, research reactors, Marie Curie's institute, Einstein's apartment, nuclear medicine areas of hospitals, uranium mines, nuclear bomb sites, and interviewed numerous experts.Notes about measuring radiation:Sieverts are a measure of 'effective dose' - that means they measure the biological impact of the energy transferred to tissues from radiation.Obviously I owe a debt to the fantastic chart made by xkcd, which inspired my visual approach to this video.https://xkcd.com/radiation/DOSES MAY VARYThe level of radiation varies widely around the world depending mainly on altitude and geology (excluding nuclear accidents).Estimates of particular doses also vary.

It's also worth noting that the vapours themselves are very flamable, so keep sparks and open flames well away from your work area during use. Again, this is why it's important to be in a well ventilated environment.","I'm Matt, and here on DIY Perks you'll find plenty of interesting DIY projects on a variety of topics, including computers, woodworking, electronics, audio, and more!I hope you enjoy my content, and please consider subscribing if you do!EMAIL...For project questions, the best way is either on Patreon or the Patreon chat server: http://patreon.com/diyperks as I get too many emails to keep up with.However if you want to get in touch with me directly for sponsorship enquiries, fan mail, or just to say 'hi' (no project questions please) then send an email to diyperks@gmail.com - I do get quite a few though so please allow 7 days for a response.","diy build design do it yourself maker electronics how-to science experiments","dBap_Lp-0oc"

Learn more about Search here: https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/Special thanks to J.M.E.H van Bronswijk, author of 'House Dust Biology'. We exchanged emails to make sure I got my facts straight for this video. Below is an excerpt from her email to me, responding to my claims that start with a dash:- Around half of airborne dust particles under 100um are skin scalesThis is true for climates, regions and seasons where people live mostly indoors.The 1 to 2 g of skin scales shed each 24 hours will end up in places where people are present (and rub their skin or have textile moving over the skin).You can also look at it from a different angle: What else has the same size and could contribute? That will usually be pollen from outdoor sources, also depending on season, region and climate, as well as the ventilation regime of the building.However, taken as the median value over a whole year, I consider your statement correct for regions with a temperate climate.- 53% of dust particles vacuumed from a mattress were found to be skin scalesIt depends a little on the type of mattress. For polyether mattresses the amount may even be larger.For mattresses made of natural material it could be less since the mattress-material will also give off small particles.- larger particles consist mostly of fibers, eg. cotton, paper, wool, syntheticsThat's true .. including bread crumbs ..... 🙂- skin scales seem to form a larger fraction of dust where we spend more time, e.g. in or near bed...... and on the couch used to view television or be active in gaming.It has to do with the constant production of skin scales over the 24 hours.- skin scales form a smaller fraction of dust if there are significant other sources, e.g. carpeting, dirt from outside etc.Yes, everyting you walk on with your shoes or that recieves dirt from the outside with other means, will have a lessr percentage of human skin scales.However, do not forget the skin scales of pets that will also be an active allergen for many people, and a food source for house dust mites.Information on dust particle size ©ISO.

It uses the motion of the radar and some fancy mathematics to get much higher detail images than should be possible from an antenna small enough to fit on an aircraft. This process has been extended to satellites and applies to not just the earth, but to other terrestrial bodies in the solar system, notably Venus and Titan which are eternally shrouded in clouds.For further reading I suggest looking at NASA's SAR Handbookhttps://gis1.servirglobal.net/TrainingMaterials/SAR/SARHB_FullRes.pdfAnd if you want to look at real SAR data the Alaska Satellite Facility has lots of public datahttps://asf.alaska.edu/Commercial images in this video come from Capella Space - https://www.capellaspace.com/IceEye - https://www.iceye.com/Ursa Space - https://www.ursaspace.com/Synspective - https://synspective.com/","Scott Manley is someone who fell into youtube because he felt a deep compelling need to teach people orbital mechanics and rocket science so they could play Kerbal Space Program, now, years later the gaming videos are less important and the pure science is the main thrust.

So what I learned really surprised me:There are hundreds of scientists working on this shampoo. They run crazy-sounding experiments like hanging hair near Tokyo highways to understand how real-world environments deposit dirt on hair. They use sophisticated scientific techniques like electron microscopes, nuclear magnetic resonance and gene sequencing to study dandruff on the molecular level.In fact they sequenced the entire genome of Malassezia globosa in 2002, one year after the human genome project. Their findings are published in international refereed journals. What they have found is that the Malassezia fungi create free fatty acids as byproducts of their digestion, which for some people create irritation and lead to hyper-proliferation of skin cells, flaking, histamines, inflammatory cytokines, and blood proteins reaching the surface of the skin. These findings indicate the unhealthiness of dandruff scalp and suggest a possible remedy - controlling the metabolism of the Malassezia fungi. This is achieved using different active ingredients in different products and different parts of the world, including zinc pyrithione, selenium sulfide, and piroctone olamine. With the reduction of irritants, the scalp actually expresses different genes, producing a signature more similar to a non-dandruff baseline scalp.Music from Epidemic Sound: http://epidemicsound.comMusic also by Kevin MacLeod: http://incompetech.com","An element of truth - videos about science, education, and anything else I find interesting.","science videos science science education science literacy veritasium misconceptions physics education astronomy science songs chemistry biology teaching learning","dBap_Lp-0oc"

But the optical illusions you’re about to see will prove that your eyes, along with your brain, can easily trick you! Go ahead and hit that subscribe button and ring the notification bell to join us on the Bright Side!Today’s challenge consists of 20 optical illusions, each with a question. You'll have 5 seconds to study the image and figure out the answer. Some of them will even give you some insight into your personality! For  TIMESTAMPS: 1. What’s the first thing you see in this picture? 0:532. How is this image changing? 1:293. Are these circles still? 1:544. How many faces are there? 2:255. What’s the first thing you notice in this image? 2:466. What do you see in this picture? 3:347. Is it really so obvious as it seems? 3:568. Can you read between the lines? 4:169. How many people do you see in this picture? 4:3710. Are these men the same size? 5:0111. What's happening with this image? 5:3012. Are these lines bent? 5:5413.

Can you see a sleeping woman in this picture? 9:23#opticalillusions #visualillusionMusic by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/ SUMMARY: #1. If the first thing you noticed was a dog's head, you're most likely a sociable, lively, and extroverted person.#3. After having just one look at this optical illusion, most people say that the circles are moving in different directions.#5. If the first thing you that caught your eye was a goblet, you're a reserved and calm person. You don’t need external sources of energy and motivation; you’re fine in your own thoughts and world.#7. At first glance, most people can't see anything but two trees leaning towards each other. Look closer, and you'll notice a girl with her back to the viewer. #9. You probably immediately noticed a black silhouette of a man's profile on the left. But what about the white negative space on the right?#11. This psychedelic blob seems to be moving forward ready to engulf you, especially when you look at it with your peripherals. In reality, this image is absolutely still!#13. As you're looking into these bizarre eyes, they seem to be growing larger and closer. You get it by now, right? The image doesn't actually move. #15. In this image, an attentive viewer will notice the left side of a man’s head in profile. But an even more attentive person will spot that a big black rodent of some sort is acting as the man’s hair. Talk about a unique hairdo! #17. Did you automatically assume that these butterflies are arranged in a spiral? Take a closer look, and you’ll realize that they’re actually in 5 separate circles, not a spiral at all.#19. You know the real answer to that question by now. No, the petals aren’t actually moving. But when you really scan the image, they seem as if they’re rotating. Yep, that’s just your eyes and brain playing tricks on you.Subscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more videos and articles visit:http://www.brightside.me/","Hey!

LegalEagle is all about giving you an insider’s view to the legal system.  Have some fun and learn to think like a lawyer.  I get asked a lot about whether being a practicing attorney is like being a lawyer on TV.  I love watching legal movies and courtroom dramas.  It's one of the reasons I decided to become a lawyer.  But sometimes they make me want to pull my hair out because they are ridiculous.  So I created this channel to answer your burning questions about the law and the legal profession.

A term we all use to describe something incredibly difficult. Trying to grasp all of the concepts involved in rocket science can be incredibly intimidating.My name’s Tim Dodd but I'm better known as the Everyday Astronaut. Recently I fell head over heals in love with spaceflight. My appreciation and curiosity for the subject grew into an obsession. Before you knew it, all I wanted to do was learn more and more. And the more I learned, the more I wanted to share what was making me so excited. But as someone who dropped out of college and has no technical background or degree… I really felt unqualified for the job of explaining rocket science to anyone. But the fact of the matter is, if I can learn this stuff, anyone can. Rocket science is awesome, and you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to be excited. Everyday Astronaut.

Người đầu tiên đủ điên rồ để thử bay trong mọi thứ  chạy bằng điện là một anh chàng người Pháp, khoảng 140 năm trước. Vấn đề chính khi đó là pin không dùng được lâu hoặc không đủ mạnh. Pin hiện đại của Apple, Tesla, Samsung...dùng được nhiều năm. Chà, không hẳn. Ngay cả pin của ô tô điện lớn nhất cũng không thể giữ một chiếc máy bay trên không được lâu.Hiện tại, 0,4 kg nhiên liệu dùng cho máy bay cung cấp năng lượng nhiều hơn gần 60 lần pin thông thường. Họ cần phải làm bình nhiên liệu lớn hơn 60 lần… và đổ đầy pin vào đó! Nhưng pin rất nặng. Vì vậy, bạn cần phải có máy bay điện khỏe hơn để chịu được trọng lượng đó. Khi bạn cần nhiều pin hơn, đồng nghĩa với việc khối lượng nặng hơn, bạn cần phải có máy bay khỏe hơn nữa… bạn hiểu vấn đề rồi đấy. Nhưng các kỹ sư đang cố gắng cân bằng cả hai.#soisángDẤU THỜI GIAN:Chuyến bay đầu tiên của máy bay điện có người lái 0:55Còn máy bay không người lái thì sao? 1:26 Nhân tiện, bạn không thể chế tạo một chiếc máy bay! 2:57Chiếc máy bay thương mại đầu tiên chạy hoàn toàn bằng điện 4:39Nó đang chờ đợi điều gì? 5:51 Máy bay lai 7:13 Máy bay nhiên liệu sinh học 8:04Máy bay không người lái 8:17Âm nhạc của Epidemic Sound https://www.epidemicsound.com/Nguồn tài liệu có sẵn (ảnh, đoạn ghi hình,...)https://www.depositphotos.comhttps://www.shutterstock.comhttps://www.eastnews.ru Đăng ký  Soi Sáng  https://bit.ly/2TPVZhq","Chỉ cần đi bộ về phía nắng, mọi thứ sẽ ổn thôiĐể hợp tác quảng cáo, xin liên hệ: brands@thesoul-publishing.com","Bright Side Vietnamese","dBap_Lp-0oc"

Today we continue our annual tradition of jumping into our FREEZING swimming pool on New Year’s Day! In past years, we've featured fictional heroes from the Marvel and DC Universes, as well as Star Wars. This year we chose the theme of real life heroes... #HealthcareHeroes! Who do you think was the most brave?? ✅ Also, shop our LND Mascara and NEW collection of Sweaters, Activewear, Loungewear, Joggers, Jewelry/Hair Accessories and MORE! (They all sell SO FAST!) 👉🏻 https://www.brooklynandbaileyshop.comYes, 2020 has been a tough year for pretty much everyone. We wanted to do something a bit different this year, and honor some real life hero professions by dressing up as healthcare workers, part of the the essential worker teams who worked tirelessly to help those who needed it most. We dressed up as doctors, surgeons, nurses, nurse practitioners, respiratory therapists, laboratory scientists, and laboratory technicians, etc. It was 27F outside for this year’s plunge, and the water was slightly warmer at 36F, but with the freezing rain and wind on top of it all... it was EXTREMELY cold for Texas! 😂Special thanks to our friends Asa, Brooks, Garret, and Ashley (our Hairitage employee) for jumping with us this year! Rylan, Paisley and Daxton even jumped! These peeps belong to our family or pandemic bubble, and pretty much live with us. Who do you think had the best polar plunge??
