Go! Go!” someone shouted as the rioters, some in military gear, streamed in. It was the start of the most serious attack on the Capitol since the War of 1812. The mob coursed through the building, enraged that Congress was preparing to make Trump’s electoral defeat official. “Drag them out! … Hang them out!” rioters yelled at one point, as they gathered near the House chamber.Officials in the House and Senate secured the doors of their respective chambers, but lawmakers were soon forced to retreat to undisclosed locations. Five people died on the grounds that day, including a Capitol police officer. In all, more than 50 officers were injured.To reconstruct the pandemonium inside the Capitol, The Washington Post examined text messages, photos and hundreds of videos, some of which were exclusively obtained. By synchronizing the footage and locating some of the camera angles within a digital 3-D model of the building, The Post was able to map the rioters’ movements and assess how close they came to lawmakers — in some cases feet apart or separated only by a handful of vastly outnumbered police officers.

They included Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, Kansas Sen. Roger Marshall, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville, among hundreds other congress members.At the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, we continuously evaluate our political contributions to ensure that those we support share our values and goals, said Kim Keck, BlueCross BlueShield's president and CEO, in a statement. In light of this week's violent, shocking assault on the United States Capitol, and the votes of some members of Congress to subvert the results of November's election by challenging Electoral College results, BCBSA will suspend contributions to those lawmakers who voted to undermine our democracy.The health insurance company's BLUEPAC political action committee -- supported only by employee contributions -- donated $246,750 to Republican lawmakers during the 2020 cycle. That included $10,000 to Sen. Tuberville, $1,000 to Sen. Marshall and $500 to Sen.

Thank you.The View, starring Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Meghan McCain, Sunny Hostin, Sara Haines, and Ana Navarro, is my favorite daytime show! When I started my channel in June of 2018, I decided to create a show on my channel about it, called My View on The View (MV on The View or MVOTV). In the beginning I used to broadcast not just my show about The View but also about other topics, but I have since, split my channel into two. Check out my other channel, MVMOChannel. Thank you for joining me as I comment, share, and post about my favorite show. I love your comments, thumbs ups, and even the thumbs downs!

However, I come on camera from time to time. *What is the song you use on your vid/podcast?*Help You Out by Leonell Cassio*I don't see my comment, where is it?*Youtube automatically holds potentially inappropriate comments. If yours did not post, it is possible that the Youtube algorithm pegged it as offensive or potentially so and it will not post but goes to a spam folder. You are not blocked. when I have time, I try to go and move those from spam to the main section but that is truly time consuming, so it doesn't happen regularly. If you have spammed other channels or have been blocked by a channel due to inappropriate comments, this is also a reason that the algorithm marked your comment as problematic. #theview","Hello!! My name is KS, and I've been here on YouTube vlogging about my favorite show, The View,  for over 2 1/2  years. This channel is where I broadcast my voice over show, My View On The View (MVOTV/MV on The View),regularly. My show is unique in that I focus on the table dynamics, not so much the politics. I love this show, as it has introduced me to people and ideals I simply would not have seen nor thought of prior. Thanks for joining me as I share MVOTV. My show is currently just a hobby for me, so I do not upload regularly. I look forward to you joining me!!!","the view abc the view whoopi goldberg sunny hostin joy behar sara haines meghan mccain ana navarro cardenas","_kGG-s_gYAU"
