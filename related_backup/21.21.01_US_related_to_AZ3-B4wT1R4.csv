In 2013, the trio released their debut independent single, I'm Ready. Well-received, the track peaked at number 27 on the Billboard's Top 40, and appeared the band's 2015 full-length debut album, Living Room. Since then, AJR released 2 full length albums, The Click (2017) and Neotheater (2019) featuring hit singles, Weak, Sober Up, and 100 Bad Days.

She developed a knack for music by studying piano and dance as a kid and listening to the likes of Busta Rhymes, Erykah Badu, Nicki Minaj, Drake, and more. Soon, she went from obsessing over Catwoman to ‚Äúcrate digging‚Äù on YouTube and learning Logic and composition on a midi controller. Cooking up vibrantly, candy-coated beats, dropping bars doubled-up on double entendre, and singing with claws out, Amala unlocks a sweetly sexy world soundtracked by wild hip-hop, twisted pop, and smoked-out R&B. Asserting a feline-esque dominance and a style that can only be described as every color in a box of crayons, Doja Cat‚Äôs unapologetic charisma, charm, and confidence immediately take center stage. With co-signs from Chance The Rapper, Katy Perry, Chris Brown and J.Cole among others, 2018's hit ‚ÄúMooo!‚Äù propelled Doja Cat forward and added many fans to her already feverishly loyal fan base.","","AZ3-B4wT1R4"

Although Karen Huger and Ray are back in Potomac with a beautiful new home, their 23-year ‚Äúinstitution‚Äù may be in question when Karen discovers that Ray‚Äôs feelings for her might not be the same as they used to be. Ashley Darby and Michael are in heavenly bliss with their new baby, Dean. But just when their relationship gets back on track, their newfound happiness is threatened by news of Michael‚Äôs wild night on the town. Robyn Dixon and Juan have been through hell and back, and after living under one roof with their two sons for six years, Robyn is ready to make things official. Now all she needs is for Juan to make his move or will she make hers first? Juggling a house with three kids and a new feathered friend is taking its toll on Monique Samuels. The last thing she needs is drama with Candiace, but when a night with the girls gets out of hand, their friendship takes a turn that impacts all the women. Candiace Dillard Bassett and Chris celebrate their first year of marriage and contemplate adding a baby to the equation. Before Candiace can focus on family matters, though, she must deal with her unresolved issues with Ashley and mounting conflicts with Monique. Nigerian-American Dr. Wendy Osefo, the newest housewife, is a triple threat as a professor, political analyst, and entrepreneur. She‚Äôs been married for nine years and is the mother of three children, including a newborn daughter. Never one to be underestimated, she is full of sass and ready to make her mark in Potomac.GET MORE BRAVO:Follow Bravo: http://bravo.ly/TwitterLike Bravo: http://bravo.ly/FacebookPin Bravo: http://bravo.ly/PinterestBravo Instagram: http://bravo.ly/InstagramBravo Tumblr: http://bravo.ly/TumblrBravo is the premier lifestyle and entertainment brand that drives cultural conversation around its high-quality, interactive original content across all platforms.

Most importantly, Monique is a loving wife and mom of three. Monique was born in Atlantic City, New Jersey and graduated from Pleasantville High School as the Salutatorian of her class. She went to Duquesne University to study business law on a full academic scholarship. Monique later decided to put school on hold to pursue a career in music, moved to Washington, DC and worked as an executive assistant for her entertainment attorney in order to pay the bills while she learned more about the music industry. That was where she met her future husband, former Washington Redskins offensive tackle Chris Samuels, who at the time was looking to start his own record label.Monique and Chris began a great friendship, which eventually turned romantic.

The philandering Pastor took to social meeting in an attempt to discredit his former romantic partner and to gather up Monique and her husband Chris. Oddly enough, in his address to Monique and the congregations, Jamal left Gizelle out on a limb. Never once did he address weather or not if he was messing with both women at the same time, nor did he address the validity of him saying the relationship was just for reality tv. The Pastor did however issue a few veiled threats and introduced a new batch of mess in the name of love and Jesus. There is so much here to discuss.

She developed a knack for music by studying piano and dance as a kid and listening to the likes of Busta Rhymes, Erykah Badu, Nicki Minaj, Drake, and more. Soon, she went from obsessing over Catwoman to ‚Äúcrate digging‚Äù on YouTube and learning Logic and composition on a midi controller. Cooking up vibrantly, candy-coated beats, dropping bars doubled-up on double entendre, and singing with claws out, Amala unlocks a sweetly sexy world soundtracked by wild hip-hop, twisted pop, and smoked-out R&B. Asserting a feline-esque dominance and a style that can only be described as every color in a box of crayons, Doja Cat‚Äôs unapologetic charisma, charm, and confidence immediately take center stage. With co-signs from Chance The Rapper, Katy Perry, Chris Brown and J.Cole among others, 2018's hit ‚ÄúMooo!‚Äù propelled Doja Cat forward and added many fans to her already feverishly loyal fan base.","","AZ3-B4wT1R4"
