Thank you sir.The Thunderbirds have a YouTube Channelhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_edytVWM8iumngqzTVLVwThis flight took place on May 3, 2019 in Biloxi Mississippi.  The reason it took so long to release is the high amount of research I wanted to do before releasing the video.  I even visited the Air Force Research Lab at Wright Patterson AFB to discuss some aspects of this video with Aerodynamicists.  Synchronizing all this footage and coordinating additional B Roll with the Thunderbirds Public Affairs Officer also required a lot of effort.  These are my own thoughts, not those of the U.S. Air Force or the Thunderbirds:I've been around a lot of pilots and ground crew in my life and I must say that the professionalism displayed by the Thunderbirds was astounding.  Their goal is to inspire and demonstrate the capabilities of the US Air Force, so I'll take it a step further.  If you're a smart young person who is interesting in changing your life for the better, strongly consider the Air Force.  The job market isn't the best at the moment but the Air Force still has opportunities available for you to learn incredible skills even if you're not interested in flying.  They manage everything from logistics, electronics, aerospace, cyber and even space systems.  The threats to freedom are becoming more complex, and in my experience working for the Department of Defense over a 15 year span (even longer if you count my work as a contractor) The US Air Force consists of some of the most intelligent service members our country has.  These people are book-smart, but also have the confidence to solve real world problems with their own hands.  If I have a complex aerodynamic question, my first call is usually to someone in the Air Force, because they understand these complex phenomena intuitively.  For example, in this video you would hear Flack and I talking about pitot tubes in flight.  We also had other discussions about fuel burn rates, Prandtl Glauert, weather.... all kinds of things.  Simply put, if you're looking for direction in your life, and you're good with science and math... consider the Air Force.  That being said, they also need other types of skills as well.  Logisticians, writers, creative people who know how to solve complex problems in unique ways.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~GET SMARTER SECTIONhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falconhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prandtl%E2%80%93Glauert_transformation~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~GET STUFF SECTION: (If I did this right these should be working Amazon affiliate links to purchase the stuff I like  to use.

I wasn't ACTIVELY trying to learn.  Meaning... I wasn't struggling and trying to make my brain learn.  I simply got on the bike every day, tried to operate it to the end of the driveway, turned around and tried to operate it back.  The goal was to understand how my brain figured things out on its own, without trying to force it to.  Many people have built bikes like this and figured it out in much less than 1 day by staying on the bike until they were able to master it.  I had no timelines, and was using this as an exploratory activity to learn how I learn.Do not misinterpret this to mean that I struggled and tried very hard every day for 8 months.

It uses the motion of the radar and some fancy mathematics to get much higher detail images than should be possible from an antenna small enough to fit on an aircraft. This process has been extended to satellites and applies to not just the earth, but to other terrestrial bodies in the solar system, notably Venus and Titan which are eternally shrouded in clouds.For further reading I suggest looking at NASA's SAR Handbookhttps://gis1.servirglobal.net/TrainingMaterials/SAR/SARHB_FullRes.pdfAnd if you want to look at real SAR data the Alaska Satellite Facility has lots of public datahttps://asf.alaska.edu/Commercial images in this video come from Capella Space - https://www.capellaspace.com/IceEye - https://www.iceye.com/Ursa Space - https://www.ursaspace.com/Synspective - https://synspective.com/","Scott Manley is someone who fell into youtube because he felt a deep compelling need to teach people orbital mechanics and rocket science so they could play Kerbal Space Program, now, years later the gaming videos are less important and the pure science is the main thrust.

Next I'll explain how the physics involved in flipping cats allow us to operate Space Telescopes (Seriously).So as simple of a question as this is, it turns out to be a MAJOR POINT OF STUDY in Physics, Robotics, Space Satellite Control, Weapons Development, Biomedical Engineering, etc.  It's stumped scientists and engineers since Newton's day.

It's done differently depending on what type of flow you have.  A pipe is calculated different than an airplane wing etc.Some fluid dynamicists would tell you that it's an exact science. I personally feel that it's a bit subjective. The most difficult parameter to nail down in my humble opinion is the characteristic length.It's pretty easy for pipes, you just measure the diameter... but wings, plates, vortices...get complicated quickly.You'll notice in the video I refrained from saying anything like Flow is laminar when Reynolds number is less than XXX or Flow is turbulent when Reynolds number is more than XXX.There are different schools of thought on this.  Typically the transition between laminar flow and turbulent flow occurs somewhere between 2100 and 4000 (Reynolds number is unitless).Laminar Flow:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminar_flowReynolds Number:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynolds_numberOsborne Reynoldshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_ReynoldsFeeling froggy?

First of all, we never turned the beam on more than 4 amps (50 watts)because we were having cooling issues and couldn't really monitor it up on the car.. (we tried 6 amps once but it was too bright.) So assuming the beam stayed perfectly collimated, the beam would have an area of 430 square centimeters. If the laser was running at 25% power (4 amps/50 watts) that would be about 110mw/cm2 from the telescope. However, your pupil is only half this size fully open, so a pilot could theoretically receive a 50mw/cm2 exposure.  A decent amount, but you have to remember even the smallest plane is traveling 150 miles per hour which would limit total exposure time to only 3ms( time it takes to cross a 9 inch beam). That puts it at the cusp of the maximum exposure limit, which is defined as about 10% of the dose that has a 50% chance of creating damage under worst-case conditions.  Here is the chart im referencing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_safety#/media/File:IEC60825_MPE_W_s.pngSo even under perfect conditions, this would still be 10x less than the exposure that carries a risk of damage.   That's assuming perfect conditions, but in reality it was a hazy night, the laser would not be perfectly collimated, the atmosphere would distort the beam,  the windows in the airplane would deflect some of the beam, unless the pilot was staring directly at the beam they would receive a smaller dose, I tried to keep the beam moving when up in the sky, and most planes are moving faster. all of this meaning the pilot would be exposed to a much lower amount of laser energy in the real world than under perfect conditions.  even at full power this laser is still within the safety factor of the maximum exposure limit. Plus do you know the odds of hitting a plane with a laser when your trying not to? just pick a random star in the sky and wait for a plane to fly over it.","Aloha YouTubers, I am The Backyard Scientist!I like to make videos on all the crazy stuff I do.

Alec Steele Blacksmith 2019","My name's Alec Steele and here you'll find near-daily videos documenting the process of building some awesome projects here in the shop. As a blacksmith, most of the projects start as lumps of steel, or stacks of different alloys for making damascus, that I forge out into blades, sculpture, art or tools before taking the project to the machining equipment or into the grinding room for finishing. Each project teaches me a lot and stretches the bounds of my knowledge. I make a lot of mistakes but they serve as an excellent teacher. There's always something important for me to learn in the shop! I want my work to be the spark that ignites the desire for you to get into your shop (or kitchen/basement/garage) and make something too! Whether it's stitching a leather wallet or forging a giant sword, you'll love the creative process.Be sure to follow me on instagram @alecsteele for behind the scenes and grab some awesome products at https://alecsteeleshop.com/Thanks!

The recent interest in food, combined with a large amount of 'misinformation' has driven me to start this channel.  I hope to be someone people can relate to and trust when they question how their food is grown and raised.  I also hope to become a 'smarter' farmer through my experiences with this channel.  I strongly believe we must have an open mind and a willingness to learn about others, or we cannot move forward as one.  My goal is to build the connection between farmers and consumers by facilitating a collaborative conversation amongst everyone.  I do this by sharing my day-to-day farming experiences, my opinions on certain topics, and occasionally visiting other farms and businesses to help better understand other farming and business practices.  There is no limit to where this channel may go, so please join me!!","millennial farmer mn millennial farmer farmer farming farm equipment combine agriculture john deere education comedy harvest farming simulator big tractors new farm equipment agco challenger welker farms tractors","AqqaYs7LjlM"

I find that a cover over the entryway is very important for a tool shed because it gives you a dry place to work. I like to cut lumber outside of the shed and its nice to have a parch roof. To start this build I install a facia header along both sides of the building. Then I install a ledger board on the top of the shed. This follows the same angles of the roof line. Next I use strong tie metal joist hangers to install 2x4's that extend over the front landing. Then I use a treated 2x4 board on the front of the new porch cover to bring it all together. Because this new awning is connected to the building without support I install 4x4's on the edges to give this plenty of strength.
