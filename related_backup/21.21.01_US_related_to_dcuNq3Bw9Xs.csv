m__OZ3ZsO4Y,"Five Things You Can't Do On British Television","UCBa659QWEk1AI4Tg--mrJ2A","Tom Scott","27","501.0","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m__OZ3ZsO4Y/default.jpg","tom scott|tomscott|things you might not know","Pull down this description for information on all the shows I mention, plus all my references, and some advice if you're looking to subtitle your videos!🔤🔤 SUBTITLES 🔤🔤15% of my viewers watch with subtitles! They're helpful for folks without headphones, or in loud environments, or who can't hear well, or who just like subtitles. More people will watch if subtitles are an option.Before 2020, YouTube had a volunteer community-captions system. Alas, due to spam (and, I suspect, the difficulty of porting it to the new Studio), YouTube turned it off. So your options are:OPTION 1: DO IT YOURSELFIf your video is one or two people talking, you can add subtitles easily with YouTube's tools: https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734796 - that's also possible for more complex videos, but it can be time-consuming.OPTION 2: PAY A SMALL AMOUNTIf you can afford an editor, you can afford subtitles! They only cost $1-2 per minute of audio.For simple audio, try Rev: https://www.rev.com/blog/coupon/?ref=tomscott To be clear, that's an affiliate link: you get $10 of captions free (enough for up to an 8-minute video), and I get a kickback from them. However, my opinions of Rev are mixed. They have downsides, and they may not be the right option for you!Advantages of Rev:✅ Extremely fast turnaround✅ Easy, simple, automated, self-service✅ Reasonable priceDisadvantages of Rev:🚫 Rev is a gig-economy company, with everything that entails. In 2019, transcribers raised issues including low pay. https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/25/20979249/rev-recordings-transcriptions-low-pay-complaints-freelance-transcribers🚫 Accuracy is usually acceptable for clear speech, but not the near-perfect results you'd expect from a more high-end subtitle company.🚫 They're limited to their simple, narrow, house style. That isn't ideal for videos with long sentences or many speakers.For more complicated audio or for multiple speakers, try Caption+: https://caption.plus -- a small company that produces extremely high-quality subtitles for a reasonable price.Advantages of Caption+:✅ Exceptional subtitle accuracy.✅ Hand-tweaked broadcast-standard subtitles that are perfect for accessibility, and which the audience love.✅ Can use positioning and per-speaker colors, and match other style requests.✅ Still a reasonable price.Disadvantages of Caption+:🚫 Not automated: you're dealing with a human by email, and paying invoices.OTHER COMPANIES: I also used 3PlayMedia once, but unfortunately can't recommend them based on that experience. YouTube also mention ceilo24 and Amara, neither of which I have experience with: https://cielo24.com/ https://amara.org/📺📺 SHOWS 📺📺Here's a list of all the shows mentioned, with links where available.

What’s she doing with it?Read Sara’s article about the privacy settings on your smart speaker: https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/12/9/22160427/amazon-alexa-google-assistant-siri-holidaysCorrection: At 0:58, we mistakenly suggest that every 1 in 5 American households has a smart speaker. In fact, over one-third of U.S. adults has a smart speaker. We regret the error.In 2014, Amazon debuted a simple but industry-changing product: the smart speaker. Technically the Amazon Echo was just a microphone attached to the internet that you installed in your home. But it let users ask a digital assistant, Alexa, thousands of questions and commands, and it was a hit. Before long, Google and Apple followed with their own smart speakers, and today, a device that began as a curiosity has become commonplace: one in five US households now owns a smart speaker.Smart speakers offer convenience; much of their popularity can simply be chalked up to that. But tech companies are also clearly pushing the technology onto consumers hard, sometimes selling smart speakers at rock-bottom prices, and building the “listening” technology that drives them into all sorts of other products, from headphones to doorbells. And a big reason for that is all the data that they produce.Just like our web searches, online purchases, and social networks, every command you give to a smart speaker is a new piece of data that tech companies own. Most likely, your voice recordings are already being used for improving those companies’ listening algorithms and ad targeting, but there’s very little transparency and no way to know exactly how they use human voice data. All we really know is that these devices have enabled their manufacturers to collect gigantic troves of voice recordings — and that opting out of it isn’t always easy.Open Sourced is a year-long reporting project from Recode by Vox that goes deep into the closed ecosystems of data, privacy, algorithms, and artificial intelligence.

And I think that's a mistake, because volume just isn't something the human brain is great at. So instead, here's the difference between a million and a billion, in a more one-dimensional way: distance.REFERENCES:Humphrey Yang's rice TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@humphreytalks/video/6798276393634467077and his YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/HumphreyYangThe Corridor Crew billion video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbVb63qPDQ8FAQ:Q: Is this accurate?A: Yes. The GPS track on the GoPro wasn't great, though, so the walking sections had to be manually smoothed out. For the main car drive, I relied on a backup GPS tracker taking a sample every 1 second. That data was loaded into an After Effects expression, set to $1 per 0.1093mm. If it couldn't pick up a GPS reading (for example, in the Chestfield Tunnel), it waited until signal returned and then calculated an average speed for the gap. There was one correction: during a stop next to a large lorry, the GPS lost tracking and wandered about 50m in a random pattern while the car was completely at a halt. Those errors were removed.Q: Why is this in 50fps?A: The electricity grid in the UK runs at 50Hz, which means that you can get strobing effects from lighting. Normally that wouldn't matter on something filmed outside, and I'd go with 60fps, but I didn't want to risk full-screen strobing in the tunnel section. (You do still see strobing on some variable message signs, but that's for different technical reasons.) As 24/25fps feels too slow and jerky for a continuous dashcam shot, this was the best option. Q: Why did you do this with American dollars in the UK?A: The Bank of England doesn't produce a £1 note. The smallest paper money we have is £5. (The Royal Bank of Scotland, and the banks of some of the Channel Islands, do though!) And while it would have been apt to do this along desert roads in California, sometimes you've got to make do with what's available.Q: What was that oops about a minute into the drive?A: I nearly turned left one junction too soon, which would have sent me to a closed barrier and ruined the take.Q: Why do you change lanes so much?A: In the UK, the correct thing to do is to always switch to the leftmost possible lane after overtaking on a motorway, unless there's another car you'll have to overtake soon or you're approaching a slip road. This means you have to change lanes a lot more than in many other countries. Source: https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/advice/driving-advice/middle-lane-hogging/Q: You pass a van on the left at one point. Is that legal?A: Deliberately passing on the left (undertaking) in the UK is considered dangerous driving on non-motorways and in free-flowing motorway traffic. However, in congestion when traffic is slowed down, keeping up with traffic in your lane is fine. Source: https://www.askthe.police.uk/content/Q891.htmQ: What do those white signs with a black stripe mean?A: National speed limit applies. On dual carriageways (divided highways), that means 70mph; on other roads, it's lower. Alas, it does not mean no speed limit like it does on the German autobahn.Q: What does the signs with the white C in a red circle mean?A: Those are reminders about the Dart Charge, the £2.50 toll for crossing the Thames at Dartford.Q: How many attempts did this take?A: Three. Attempt one was ruined by the time of day: I was travelling east in the morning -- so all the camera could see was glare from the sun and the dashboard reflected in the windscreen. Attempt two was ruined by the camera overheating shortly after the Dartford Crossing. (That's why this is in 2.7k, not 4k, and why you can hear wind noise from the air conditioning blowing over the camera to keep it cool.)Q: How can this be an FAQ when you wrote it before the video went live?A: In this case, FAQ stands for Fully Anticipated Questions.Q: What's your route?00:00 Introduction02:14 Leaving Dagenham06:03 A13 Eastbound12:43 Mar Dyke Interchange14:26 A28216:07 Queen Elizabeth II Bridge20:50 A2 Eastbound30:16 M2 Eastbound53:36 Thanet Way Eastbound1:08:09 A28 towards Margate1:12:09 Local roads towards Margate1:14:39 Ah good, the sea1:17:29 ConclusionI'm at https://tomscott.comon Twitter at https://twitter.com/tomscotton Facebook at https://facebook.com/tomscottand on Instagram as tomscottgo","Hi, I'm Tom Scott.

It uses the motion of the radar and some fancy mathematics to get much higher detail images than should be possible from an antenna small enough to fit on an aircraft. This process has been extended to satellites and applies to not just the earth, but to other terrestrial bodies in the solar system, notably Venus and Titan which are eternally shrouded in clouds.For further reading I suggest looking at NASA's SAR Handbookhttps://gis1.servirglobal.net/TrainingMaterials/SAR/SARHB_FullRes.pdfAnd if you want to look at real SAR data the Alaska Satellite Facility has lots of public datahttps://asf.alaska.edu/Commercial images in this video come from Capella Space - https://www.capellaspace.com/IceEye - https://www.iceye.com/Ursa Space - https://www.ursaspace.com/Synspective - https://synspective.com/","Scott Manley is someone who fell into youtube because he felt a deep compelling need to teach people orbital mechanics and rocket science so they could play Kerbal Space Program, now, years later the gaming videos are less important and the pure science is the main thrust.

A perfect topic for a Christmas video. Before I forget, the winner of the lucky draw announced in my last video is  Zachary Kaplan. He wins a copy of my book  Q.E.D.

First program contributed.)Viktor Chlumský https://youtu.be/CCL77BUymSY (no program but a VERY beautiful animation made with the software Shadron by Victor)Cannot fit any more links in this description because of the character limit. For lots of other amazing implementations check out the list in my comment pinned to the top of the comment section of the video.For the most accessible exposition of iterated shuffling that I am aware of have a look at the relevant chapter in the book Integer partitions by Andrews and Eriksson. They also have a nice set of exercises that walk you through proofs for the properties of iterated shuffling that I mention in this video. I used Dan Romik's old Mac program ASM Simulator to produce the movie of the random tilings of growing Aztec diamond boards https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~romik/software/ Sadly this program does not work on modern Macs. The arctic heart at the end of the video is a chistmasized version of an image from the article What is a Dimer by Richard Kenyon and Andrei Okounkov https://www.ams.org/notices/200503/what-is.pdf Thank you for letting me use this image.Around the same time that Kasteleyn published the paper I showed in the video, the physicists  Temperley and Fisher published similar results, Dimer problem in statistical mechanics-an exact result, Philosophical Magazine, 6:68, (1961) 1061-1063. The way Kasteleyn as well as Temperley and Fisher calculated the numbers of tilings of  boards with square tiles was a bit more complicated than the nice refinement that I show in the video which is due to Jerome K. Percus, One more technique for the dimer problem. J. Mathematical Phys., 10:1881–1888, 1969.Some great articles and websites to check out:A very accessible introduction to domino and other tilings by Federico Adila and Richard Stanley http://www.claymath.org/library/senior_scholars/stanley_ardila_tilings.pdfAn accessible article about tilings with rectangles by my colleague Norm Do at Monash Uni. In particular, it's got some more good stuff about the maths of fault lines in tilings that I only hinted at in the video: http://users.monash.edu/~normd/documents/Mathellaneous-07.pdf  A nice article about Kasteleyn's method by James Propp. Includes a proof of the crazy formula  https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.2615 A fantastic survey article about enumeration of tilings by James Propp. This one's got everything imaginable domino and otherwise. Also the bibliography at the end is very comprehensive http://faculty.uml.edu/jpropp/eot.pdfAn introduction to the dimer model by Richard Kenyonhttps://arxiv.org/abs/math/0310326Alternating sign matrices and domino tilings by Noam Elkies, Greg Kuperberg, Michael Larsen, James Propp https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9201305Random Domino Tilings and the Arctic Circle Theorem by William Jockusch, James Propp, and Peter Shor https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9801068A website by Alexei Borodin full of amazing 3d representations of domino tilings. A must-see http://math.mit.edu/~borodin/aztec.htmlJames Propp's name pops up a couple of times throughout this video and in this description. He's one of the mathematicians who discovered all the beautiful arctic mathematics that I am talking about in this video and helped me get my facts straight. Check out his blog  http://mathenchant.org  and in particular in this post he talks a little bit about the discovery of the arctic circle phenomenon https://mathenchant.wordpress.com/2016/1/16/how-to-be-wrong/As usual the music in the video is from the free YouTube audio library: Night Snow by Asher Fulero and Fresh fallen snow by Chris Haugen.Today's t-shirts I got ages ago.

LegalEagle is all about giving you an insider’s view to the legal system.  Have some fun and learn to think like a lawyer.  I get asked a lot about whether being a practicing attorney is like being a lawyer on TV.  I love watching legal movies and courtroom dramas.  It's one of the reasons I decided to become a lawyer.  But sometimes they make me want to pull my hair out because they are ridiculous.  So I created this channel to answer your burning questions about the law and the legal profession.

Perhaps the Marble Machine X itself is the Local Maximum, in that case, the current process will lead me to that discovery and i will take another u-turn to find the path to the world tour.

A term we all use to describe something incredibly difficult. Trying to grasp all of the concepts involved in rocket science can be incredibly intimidating.My name’s Tim Dodd but I'm better known as the Everyday Astronaut. Recently I fell head over heals in love with spaceflight. My appreciation and curiosity for the subject grew into an obsession. Before you knew it, all I wanted to do was learn more and more. And the more I learned, the more I wanted to share what was making me so excited. But as someone who dropped out of college and has no technical background or degree… I really felt unqualified for the job of explaining rocket science to anyone. But the fact of the matter is, if I can learn this stuff, anyone can. Rocket science is awesome, and you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to be excited. Everyday Astronaut.

In an obscure tomb in Thebes, she uncovers the stories of warriors who fought in the bloody battle that would eventually lead to Egypt's reunification, and reveals how settlers known as the `Hyksos' tried to infiltrate the fledgling nation's government to seize the throne.📺  It's like Netflix for history...

With over 80% of Americans living in a Urban/Suburban environment, many lack the basics to ensure they have the necessary food, water, medical skills and security in the event of a catastrophe. City Prepping's chief aim is to help provide survival basics for every day people that is practical and easy to implement to be prepared should calamity strike.The author of the channel has a degree in MicroBiology and a background in mountain climbing, outdoorsmanship, and NGO work in 3rd world countries like Afghanistan and Mexico and currently works in the tech industry.  Living in Southern California under the threat of the big one (earthquake), the need to learn how to prepare for a very catastrophic event has led City Prepping to spend many hours studying and preparing his own household.","Prepping Emergency Preparedness","dcuNq3Bw9Xs"
