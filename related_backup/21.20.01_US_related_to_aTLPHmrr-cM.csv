I live in East Village in a 250 square foot studio. My rent was originally $2000 per month, but was recently reduced to $1800 per month, which is about the current market rate for a studio apartment in NYC. I told myself I’d chill out on the decor this time, so I was originally planning on keeping the place pretty minimalist and not recording an apartment makeover. But as they say.. you can lead an Ashley to an apartment, but you can’t make her resist her impulse to wallpaper every single surface. So anyways, here’s my apartment tour, complete with a small jungle worth of house plants, an abundance of vintage gold mirrors, my trusty pink armchair, and some questionable NYC storage solutions. I’m not quite sure how to describe my decor aesthetic - it’s somewhere between grandma chic, tumblr chic, and i-own-way-too-much-stuff-so-i-hid-everything-in-ikea-boxes chic. I hope you enjoy and thanks for checking out my place! :)✰ MY OUTFIT ✰dress: aritzia (https://bit.ly/37vG8iq)earrings: i designed them!

It scratched the surface of several things I could have gone into more detail about, but the purpose of this was to be ..reasonably concise and above all entertaining. In the future, in the right places, I will surely talk much more about everything touched on in this video and more. It’s also likely that something will get misunderstood or misrepresented, perhaps from the way I phrased things or people assuming my thoughts on things that I didn’t specify. Also my story is just the truth of what happened to me and what I thought at certain points of time in my environment, good and bad - of course not my opinions today. So JUST to be clear my opinion on general sexual and gender identities are that everyone is valid and deserves equal rights and the freedom to exist. The only thing I don’t tolerate is intolerance.

Apparently things didn't go very well for her and she left early. Jeffree, his makeup and his hair guy were talking a lot of mean and horrible things behind Trisha’s back. Things like her hair and her skin, her weight and how much money she makes and stuff like that. Just really mean and nasty comments. A long time friend of Jeffree - Tab posted a video explaining why he does no longer support Jeffree and talked about the Vegas Trip. There are also dms between Tab and Trisha, that show Trisha isn’t making this up and something really happened on that trip.🔴 Get my YouTube Creator MasterClass FREE for 14 days:https://skl.sh/34V3Kvt(You can unsubscribe before your first payment)🔴 Subscribe to my personal finance channel:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWeUT2TcnxwCzJeaMyt3bMQ🔴 Subscribe to my second channel:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt9IIZsLLXwmPcrEVAFhM8Q✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨FOLLOW ME! ❤️ 📸Instagram: @reyrahimihttps://www.instagram.com/reyrahimi/🐦Twitter: @rey_rahimihttps://twitter.com/rey_rahimi🎶TikTok: @reyrahimihttps://www.tiktok.com/@reyrahimi✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨🔗LINKS:- Earn cashback money with Rakuten: https://www.rakuten.com/r/REYHAN24?eeid=28187- Earn cashback money with Honey: https://www.joinhoney.com/ref/v9nj9lh✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨For business inquiries: reyhanehrahimi2@gmail.com✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨📺WATCH: I paid for ____'s OnlyFans so you don't have to:- Trisha paytas: https://youtu.be/LMT2ZbeMcbI- Nikocado Avocado: https://youtu.be/ahUGQLXljF0- Onision: https://youtu.be/3d_CWo6eov0- Lena the Plug: https://youtu.be/Q__mMarUnjk- iDubbbz's Girlfriend: https://youtu.be/qBCcw8PjHs4- Nick Snider: https://youtu.be/SIKV3GKX4zs- My subscribers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyBTtSeW2Ak&t=683s- Trisha Paytas (YET AGAIN): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGsW1T5VTqE&t=314sI- Tana Mongeau: https://youtu.be/IZaDei0YGeU- Trisha Paytas' sister: https://youtu.be/4-bE0AC1erQ- Venus Angelic: https://youtu.be/MlvIWBliQKA- Belle Delphine: https://youtu.be/kFKZrzdg9bc- Aaron Carter: https://youtu.be/7o-rbXxEzAI","Hi my name is Rey Rahimi and I spill tea","tea spill news spilled youtubers david dobrik logan paul jake tana mongeau trisha paytas rey rahimi rey rahimi","aTLPHmrr-cM"
