This thing is the ultimate challenge in aerospace engineering, a FULLY and rapidly reusable super heavy lift launch vehicle, capable of taking 150 metric tonnes to low Earth orbit. But Starship’s ultimate goal goes way beyond just terrestrial orbital ambitions, Starship is the first vehicle designed to actually take human beings to Mars and back again.In order to achieve this absolutely bonkers goal, SpaceX has had to employ a litany of new technologies, use new materials, develop the most advanced rocket engines ever made and come up with some wild ideas that have never been tried before… and maybe for good reason.So today I wanted to go over all of these new technologies and compare it to SpaceX’s Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy to help point out what things are new, what things are different and what they’ve learned from the Falcon family that will apply to Starship in order to really understand just how ambitious this project is.We won’t be just scratching the surface here, in fact we’ll actually be taking you inside the rockets and showing you basically every single part and going over all of them with a fine tooth comb so you can learn as much as possible and have a definitive guide to Starship.Article version - https://www.everydayastronaut.com/definitive-guide-to-starshipStarship Playlist - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWzKfs3icbT606L4GDeUxJD-pXynjhK2vIs SpaceX's Raptor engine the king of rocket engines? - https://youtu.be/LbH1ZDImaI8A conversation with Elon Musk about Starship - https://youtu.be/cIQ36Kt7UVgSLS Vs Starship: Why does SLS still exist? - https://youtu.be/KA69Oh3_obYWhy won't Starship have an abort system? - https://youtu.be/v6lPMFgZU5QWhy SpaceX switched to stainless steel - https://youtu.be/LogE40_wR9kWhy SpaceX's Starship will fall like a skydiver and not fly - https://youtu.be/SCCw_M8MAU0Will Starship make Artemis better than Apollo? - https://youtu.be/9O15vipueLsWhy Starship will only have 2 rear fins instead of 3 - https://youtu.be/hsul-GE4XiAHow much do rockets pollute? - https://youtu.be/C4VHfmiwuv4Timestamps:00:00 - Intro05:05 - What's the same06:00 - What’s Different // Engines and Fuels23:05 - What's Different // Size, Capabilities, Construction, Costs32:15 - What's Different // First Stage Reuse41:50 - What's Different // Second Stage Reuse53:40 - Conclusion-------------------------Special thanks to Caspar Stanley, subscribe to his channel! - https://www.youtube.com/stanleycreativeWant to support what I do?

A term we all use to describe something incredibly difficult. Trying to grasp all of the concepts involved in rocket science can be incredibly intimidating.My name’s Tim Dodd but I'm better known as the Everyday Astronaut. Recently I fell head over heals in love with spaceflight. My appreciation and curiosity for the subject grew into an obsession. Before you knew it, all I wanted to do was learn more and more. And the more I learned, the more I wanted to share what was making me so excited. But as someone who dropped out of college and has no technical background or degree… I really felt unqualified for the job of explaining rocket science to anyone. But the fact of the matter is, if I can learn this stuff, anyone can. Rocket science is awesome, and you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to be excited. Everyday Astronaut.

It’s also almost time for the first Cargo Dragon version 2 (CRS-21) to come home after the fully autonomous capsule docked with the International Space Station on December 7 last year. We had the first Falcon 9 launch of 2021 with the Turksat 5A mission, and we also take a look back at the Mars Spirit and Opportunity Rovers that landed on the red planet seventeen years ago.

The crew launched on Saturday, May 30 on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida and arrived at the orbiting laboratory on May 31. The SpaceX Crew Dragon “Endeavour” splashed down off the coast of Pensacola, Florida, Sunday, Aug. 2 at 2:48 pm EDT following their undocking from the International Space Station Saturday, Aug. 1 at 7:35 pm EDT. During their 62 days aboard station, Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley contributed more than 100 hours of time to supporting the orbiting laboratory’s investigations, participated in public engagement events, and supported four spacewalks with Behnken and Cassidy to install new batteries in the station’s power grid and upgrade other station hardware.  These activities are a part of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, which has been working with the U.S. aerospace industry to launch astronauts on American rockets and spacecraft from American soil the International Space Station for the first time since 2011. This is SpaceX’s final test flight and is providing data about the performance of the Falcon 9 rocket, Crew Dragon spacecraft and ground systems, as well as in-orbit, docking, splashdown and recovery operations.   The test flight also will help NASA certify SpaceX’s crew transportation system for regular flights carrying astronauts to and from the space station. SpaceX is readying the hardware for the first rotational mission that will occur following NASA certification, which is expected to take about six weeks.  The goal of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program is safe, reliable and cost-effective transportation to and from the International Space Station. This could allow for additional research time and increase the opportunity for discovery aboard humanity’s testbed for exploration, including helping us prepare for human exploration of the Moon and Mars.","NASA's mission is to pioneer the future in space exploration, scientific discovery and aeronautics research. To do that, thousands of people have been working around the world and in space for more than 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there -- or learn just by trying to get there -- that will make life better here on Earth?NASA's work is diverse: proving flight technologies; creating capabilities for sustainable human and robotic exploration; exploring Earth, the solar system and the universe beyond; developing critical enabling technologies such as the space shuttle; and conducting science in orbit aboard the International Space Station. With NASA you can explore the universe and discover Earth.","","9I0UYXVqIn8"

Some 12 minutes after a spectacular liftoff from Launch Pad 39-A, Crew Dragon separated from the second stage of the Falcon 9 rocket and Hurley and Behnken began monitoring a series of test objectives for the duration of the vehicle’s 19-hour flight to the orbital outpost in the first crewed mission for the Commercial Crew Program. The veteran astronauts are scheduled to oversee an automated docking of Crew Dragon to the station May 31 to join NASA astronaut and Expedition 63 Commander Chris Cassidy of NASA and Russian crewmates Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner.","NASA's mission is to pioneer the future in space exploration, scientific discovery and aeronautics research. To do that, thousands of people have been working around the world and in space for more than 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What's out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there -- or learn just by trying to get there -- that will make life better here on Earth?NASA's work is diverse: proving flight technologies; creating capabilities for sustainable human and robotic exploration; exploring Earth, the solar system and the universe beyond; developing critical enabling technologies such as the space shuttle; and conducting science in orbit aboard the International Space Station. With NASA you can explore the universe and discover Earth.","","9I0UYXVqIn8"

It's a concept originally presented by Robert Zubrin, which is appealing because it looks more scientifically plausable than many other futuristic propulsion concepts.It's also scary on so many levels, using a propellent that has to be stabilized by specially designed tanks, and relies on managing a small nuclear explosion with power outputs of hundreds of gigawatts.The original paper can be read here:https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.1990-2371And Atomic Rockets has a section on the device:http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/enginelist2.php#nswrThe Kerbal mod version is available as part of Nertea's Far Future Technologies:https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/199070-111x-far-future-technologies-jan-7/","Scott Manley is someone who fell into youtube because he felt a deep compelling need to teach people orbital mechanics and rocket science so they could play Kerbal Space Program, now, years later the gaming videos are less important and the pure science is the main thrust.

Thank you sir.The Thunderbirds have a YouTube Channelhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_edytVWM8iumngqzTVLVwThis flight took place on May 3, 2019 in Biloxi Mississippi.  The reason it took so long to release is the high amount of research I wanted to do before releasing the video.  I even visited the Air Force Research Lab at Wright Patterson AFB to discuss some aspects of this video with Aerodynamicists.  Synchronizing all this footage and coordinating additional B Roll with the Thunderbirds Public Affairs Officer also required a lot of effort.  These are my own thoughts, not those of the U.S. Air Force or the Thunderbirds:I've been around a lot of pilots and ground crew in my life and I must say that the professionalism displayed by the Thunderbirds was astounding.  Their goal is to inspire and demonstrate the capabilities of the US Air Force, so I'll take it a step further.  If you're a smart young person who is interesting in changing your life for the better, strongly consider the Air Force.  The job market isn't the best at the moment but the Air Force still has opportunities available for you to learn incredible skills even if you're not interested in flying.  They manage everything from logistics, electronics, aerospace, cyber and even space systems.  The threats to freedom are becoming more complex, and in my experience working for the Department of Defense over a 15 year span (even longer if you count my work as a contractor) The US Air Force consists of some of the most intelligent service members our country has.  These people are book-smart, but also have the confidence to solve real world problems with their own hands.  If I have a complex aerodynamic question, my first call is usually to someone in the Air Force, because they understand these complex phenomena intuitively.  For example, in this video you would hear Flack and I talking about pitot tubes in flight.  We also had other discussions about fuel burn rates, Prandtl Glauert, weather.... all kinds of things.  Simply put, if you're looking for direction in your life, and you're good with science and math... consider the Air Force.  That being said, they also need other types of skills as well.  Logisticians, writers, creative people who know how to solve complex problems in unique ways.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~GET SMARTER SECTIONhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falconhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prandtl%E2%80%93Glauert_transformation~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~GET STUFF SECTION: (If I did this right these should be working Amazon affiliate links to purchase the stuff I like  to use.

We fell in love with the retro futuristic Mars landscapes depicted in the posters and decided to bring them to life. Our challenge was to create a storyline that could compliment the style of the posters yet be interesting, unexpected and fun.Currently, we continue to follow our passion of making artwork dedicated to the future of technology and space exploration. We hope that with our animation we will get SpaceX and Elon to create some new posters and one day invite us on a trip to Mars!Directed by Vasil Hnatiuk https://www.vantage-films.com/3D animation Dennis Sibilev https://www.behance.net/TheSibilev2D animation Andrei Myshev https://vimeo.com/myshevAdditional animation Mariia Tyapkina https://vimeo.com/user86357380 and Marina Patrakeeva https://vimeo.com/user96083712Sound Design Juan Borda http://bordasound.com/-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SpaceX is one of many space organizations out there right now trying to get to the people of Earth to Mars, and not just get us there, but allow us to colonize the planet. They have a plan to do it, and it's quite detailed, but there are some questions you no doubt have. Such as...how will we get there?That is the question, isn't it? After all, if traveling to Mars was easy...we would've done it by now. When in fact, traveling to Mars is rather hard its best days. While Earth and Mars are technically neighbors, their distances apart is anywhere from 225-401 million kilometers away. It just depends on the day and part of the year they are in their orbits around the sun (as they move at different speeds around the star and have quite a distance between them).Because of this distance, if you convert the Mars distance to miles, you'll see that to travel to the Sun is actually 2.5 times easier than it would be to travel to Mars in terms of distances. Comparing Mars travel to the moon travel, that's 986 times farther. That's quite a distance, and with our current technology, that travel would be on the verge a year give or take depending on how big the ship is, the passengers, weight, and more. If you're a movie buff, you'll be reminded of the film The Martian, where an astronaut is left on the planet and his friends have to travel from Earth to Mars to get him. It took a very long time. AND, their ship was specially built to make that trip. At present, humanity has only built probes and satellites and rovers that have gone to Mars.However, that is changing, and changing quickly. The SpaceX program is preparing their own colonization of Mars, and to start this off, they're sending cargo ships to the red planet via their Big Falcon Rocket. They're truly preparing this right now, and aim to launch the first of these cargo ships in 2022. And once those touchdown, they'll send out the first wave of colonists in 2024.If you're wondering what will be on these cargo ships, that's very easy. To help speed up the process of both landing on Mars and setting up the first Martian base, SpaceX will use their BRF ships to go and place food, energy supplies, mining and building equipment, and more on the planet. That way, once the astronauts get off the ship and make sure that everything is ok, they can get to work setting everything up.Now, obviously, since it's still 2020 at present, that mean things could change, and the technology could hit a breakthrough that allows them to get to Mars even faster. Or set things up even quicker in terms of the base. But the point we need to make here is that these BFRs are the best chance we have of getting Mars at a good period of time with people on them. And once that happens, the colonization can begin.Once you get over the question of, How do we land on Mars?, the next question that needs to be asked is, Where do we land on Mars? After all, landing at a key position, one that can help sustain the life of the colonists, is vital.#InsaneCuriosity#SpaceX  #MarsEverythingAbout","Insane Curiosity is a Science and Technology channel, which teach mostly about astronomy (Space, Recent Space Discoveries,  Future Events, Exoplanets, Mars, Colonization Plans, Physics.3-7 New videos per week.

Just in these days is leaking the news of the reception of a radio signal that seems to come from the same direction in which Proxima Centauri is located. A star too faint to be seen by the Earth with the naked eye, but which has a unique feature: it is in fact the closest star to our solar system, just 4.2 light years away. The signal has such characteristics as to prevent it from being dismissed a priori as a terrestrial interference, raising the vague possibility that it is a transmission that may come from some form of technologically advanced extraterrestrial intelligence. Seti detected this strange signal.- -Subscribe for more videos ►https://www.youtube.com/c/InsaneCuriosity?sub_confirmation=1?Business Enquiries ► Lorenzovareseaziendale@gmail.comWe have Another Channel ► Down The Rabbit Hole https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqdTuLTekIsdgaIKjwj4D-A- -Picking up that strange radio emission were some of the astronomers involved in the Breakthrough Listen Project, promoted in 2015 by Russian billionaire Yuri Milner to detect forms of intelligence in the cosmos. An ambitious program, with a budget of $ 100 million to be spent in ten years, a kind of SETI Renaissance that sees in the front row the most prestigious names in research and the main Observatories of the world.  A goal to be achieved by funding the purchase of observation time on radio telescopes around the world and checking one by one at least one million stars in our nearby universe.And it was thanks to this Joint venture between capital and advanced technology that on April 29, 2019, the Parkes radio telescope, located in Australia's New South Wales, was pointed at the star Proxima Centauri. Not so much in search of aliens, but to study the giant flashes of light that Red Dwarf stars like Proxima frequently emit.The second feature, really very suggestive, is that the signal has a slight Doppler effect, compatible with transmission from a moving planet. And as we know, Proxima Centauri has a planetary system consisting of a gas giant and a rocky body, Proxima b, a little bit bigger than the Earth...But seriously Could the signal come from that planet?

L is targeted for 11:17 a.m. EST, or 16:17 UTC. Dragon will separate from Falcon 9’s second stage about eleven minutes after liftoff and autonomously dock to the space station on Monday, December 7.  This is the first flight of the updated cargo version of Dragon, which is capable of carrying about 20 percent more volume than the previous version of Dragon and has double the amount of powered locker cargo capability. Dragon is now designed for up to five flights to and from the space station, and this cargo version of the spacecraft can stay on station for a duration more than twice as long as the previous version of Dragon. The Falcon 9 first stage rocket booster supporting this launch previously supported launch of Dragon’s first flight with NASA astronauts to the International Space Station (Demo-2), the ANASIS-II mission, and a Starlink mission. Following stage separation, SpaceX will land Falcon 9’s first stage on the “Of Course I Still Love You” droneship, which will be located in the Atlantic Ocean.","SpaceX designs, manufactures and launches the world’s most advanced rockets and spacecraft.","","9I0UYXVqIn8"

Recently I fell head over heals in love with spaceflight. My appreciation and curiosity for the subject grew into an obsession. Before you knew it, all I wanted to do was learn more and more. And the more I learned, the more I wanted to share what was making me so excited. But as someone who dropped out of college and has no technical background or degree… I really felt unqualified for the job of explaining rocket science to anyone.

This is the first full teardown, so I'm really pleased that I get to be the first to share this with the world. Huge kudos to the Starlink team – this is incredible work, and it must feel great to know that users are finally getting their hands on it.This video was shot/edited quickly, so please forgive the quality.

Optical crosslinks are not in v1.0 Starlink satellites.– [@TMFAssociates] RF frequencies as stated are incorrect. They should be 10.7-12.7GHz Rx and 14.0-14.5GHz Tx.– [Aaron Huslage] This is not FR4, but probably Rogers RO4000-series material or something with a low Dk.– [nraynaud1] kindly reminded me that a differential gear configuration allows us to infer control of both azimuth AND elevation (🤦‍♂️), which I have verified with a bench power supply. Although Dishy currently only controls elevation, a future Dishy update should allow it to point any direction it pleases 📡– [Ergzay] corrects the above correction (lol) and says that Dishy is _currently_ capable of changing its azimuth and elevation – a behavior I hadn't previously seen. The more you know 🌈=====💬 SUGGESTIONSThe accuracy of these suggestions can't be verified yet, but I'm sharing them here for everybody:– [Marcel Dejean] LO_CLK would be local oscillator clock - the reference clock for the RF oscillator's phase locked loop.– [Oleg Kutkov] Those copper elements above antenna patches look like a polarizer to me. Starlink uses circular polarization waves and these are probably the elements that convert circular wave to linear and vice versa.=====✏️ IC MARKINGS** Chip markings that were not legible in the video ** (where '/' denotes a new line)– the smaller ICs that I'm calling phase shifters or switchers are marked: GLL / AA62 / 946P / AEBJ– the larger IC that I suspect is an integrated RF frontend: VQ944833 / GLLBSUABBBA / HPAPUKOR GL– the IC that I refer to as a clock distribution amplifier: GLLBLU / HPAQR VQ / KOR 006 / ACBF (e2)– the application processor or RFIC: GLLCC0CA6BF","Design, software, hardware, and sensors!","design engineering electrical hardware software programming reverse-engineering hacking development product","9I0UYXVqIn8"

Tune in to our live broadcast as our spacecraft descends to the surface of asteroid Bennu, touches down for a few seconds & attempts to capture regolith (rocks and dust) using a “Touch-And-Go,” or TAG, maneuver. The spacecraft must target Bennu’s rocky surface with great accuracy, touching down within a rocky area just 52 ft (16 m) in diameter. During the maneuver, the spacecraft and the asteroid will be approximately 207 million miles (334 million km) from Earth.Live coverage from Lockheed Martin's facility in Denver, Colorado, with mission managers from the University of Arizona, Lockheed Martin, and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center begins at 5 p.m. EDT. The spacecraft is scheduled to depart Bennu in 2021, and to deliver the collected sample to Earth on Sep. 24, 2023. It will be the first U.S. mission to carry samples from an asteroid back to Earth, and the largest sample returned from space since the Apollo era.","NASA's mission is to pioneer the future in space exploration, scientific discovery and aeronautics research.To do that,  we have worked around the world -- and off it -- for more than 50 years, searching for answers to fundamental questions about our place in the universe.

The passenger was about to record the landing but after minutes he witnessed a near collision with a UFO. The pilot followed safety protocol, the engines roared, and passengers panicked. The pilot managed to avoid the unidentified flying object and made a safe landing at Zurich Airport later on. Date and time of the event: January 17th, 2021 between 7:30 and 7:50 am. The passenger describes this as UFO because the identity of the flying object is unknown. It is not a drone or a bird because of its invisibility on radar. A pilot cannot see a drone or bird coming because of the small size. This video proves that the pilot is aware and prepared to dodge the UFO.Source & embed code: https://rumble.com/vcxwmd-near-mid-air-collision-with-ufo-captured-by-singapore-airlines-passenger.html.For licensing, please email licensing@rumble.com.","Bringing exclusively managed viral videos from Rumble.com.
