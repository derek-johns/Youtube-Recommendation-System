That sequel comes three years later in the form of Wonder Woman 1984, which in a historic first for a massive superhero blockbuster - came out on streaming at the same time as in theatres!Wonder Woman 1984 movie definitely raises some questions. Like why did Steve Trevor return through some random guy? Why are they using this man’s body for anything they like? Why is there a fully-fueled jet lying around at the Smithsonian and how does Steve Trevor know how to fly it? How does Diana know how to make it invisible? How did Wonder Woman get her lasso around Max Lord? How did literally everyone renounce their wishes? How did nobody wish the world to immediately end? What exactly is the message of this movie?!To answer all these questions and more, step inside the Pitch Meeting that led to Wonder Woman 1984!

In just a few generations, this territory had outmaneuvered more powerful neighbors to become the vast Ottoman Empire. What enabled its rapid rise?

If that's the case, I suggest you watch the entire video first. Reading is very important, it has many benefits for your brain, and unfortunately, school prepares us from a young age to see reading as a chore or as something unpleasant. Then there's the other type of people who only read Personal Development and Self Help books, and that's mainly who I'm targeting with this video. The Self Help industry is making billions of dollars every year, often selling sub-par written content that gives the illusion of personal growth. There's so much more value in a novel, or a history book, than you will ever find in the average Self-improvement book. So although I'm talking about why you should read less, the moral of the story - spoiler alert - is why you should read more, or why you should be more selective with the type of books you're reading. Looking forward to the conversation in the comment section.","Doing animated commentary and solving crimes with my purple goose boi Wilfur!I animate using Adobe Flash CS6, with a Wacom Intuos Pro M tablet.","animation animator andrei terbea","dMUxFSETaCY"

Technology fights for our gaze as we fill any moment of boredom with likes, scrolls and swipes. Being stuck with our own thoughts is a thing of the past, today stimulation is always at hand. But among the pings and buzzes, it's not easy to get work done. Below are a few tips to help you regain attention, particularly useful when you have creative tasks at hand: Take Control of Digital DistractionsThere is no need to go cold-turkey, heck the internet can be an amazing resource for inspiration. However, giving yourself time away from notifications and endless feeds frees you to stay in your creative zone for longer. A Stanford University study reported that people who digitally multi-task, overall perform worse and tend to remember less about what they’ve consumed than those concentrating solely on one task.If you think this is you, there are a bunch of apps designed to alter your relationship with distracting media. Alternatively, you can try old-school methods like leaving your smartphone in another room, or turning on “do not disturb” mode while working with devices connected to the internet. Then, at the end of the day give yourself half-an-hour to scroll to your heart's content, knowing you aren’t avoiding what really matters. ExerciseIncorporating exercise into your daily routine is an equally powerful way to train your brain. Researchers at the University of Illinois found physical activity significantly helps to build the brain’s ability to ignore distraction. Exercise is the most primal mood improving activity. Through taking control of physical space and your body’s movements, it puts you in the moment. Physical activity also releases endorphins, the natural hormone known for positive effects on stress and anxiety.We have created a new channel and we really need your help. 🙏 Please like, comment or subscribe.Genre: Downtempo, Electronic MusicStyle: DowntempoMood: Peaceful, Future, CyberDuration: One HourFeature: Without Lyrics📹 Similar videosAll Music VIdeos ► https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdE7uo_7KBkemG2q7FaIGsQCcCHieasOEWork Music ► https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdE7uo_7KBkc6L7Bgqzz_Q7q2JN2AqHV3Chillout Music ► https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdE7uo_7KBkeSTmryNClNxUkioFpq3BtxStudy Music ► https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdE7uo_7KBkcx8_AcwRjTPiYSauQTQeNiProgramming Music ► https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdE7uo_7KBkfAWkk7-Clm18krBuziKQfrAmbient Music ► https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdE7uo_7KBketYRDDb8lheUOD4q7U27DRChillstep Music ► https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdE7uo_7KBkeH0adsnxZupMARfGxY6qikChillhop Music ► https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdE7uo_7KBkdmK1rCN4D-GO9g79QXqdVdLo-Fi Music ► https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdE7uo_7KBkcywzGlsZ9c6aerJr3tK058Contemporary Classic ► https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdE7uo_7KBkdg39l-YqG9eXanlNBiSgzf🎧 Tracklist► 00:00 Grandyzer - Hunter In The Snow► 06:24 Alone - Voices► 12:13 Grandyzer, Sinius - Disembody► 18:07 Wandr - Luna► 22:00 Fourge - Our Embrace► 26:36 Speh - Outside Myself► 30:56 AK - Icicle► 34:04 Fugaru - Night Sky► 36:56 Michael FK - Towards The Dawn► 40:36 Nomyn - Mirage► 44:16 Michael FK - Go Back► 50:03 Venture - Fragments► 55:34 Kosh Anade - Hills► 59:32 Kermukine - Planes of Nature► 1:05:12 Delectatio - Magical► 1:08:47 Grandyzer - Closer📷 Image author Colin Anderson https://www.stocksy.com/2689519/ai-birth #CreativeMusic #NightWorkMusic #DeepDowntempo","When we created this channel, we wanted to shed some light on how the music is made, educate and help people on how to navigate the intricacies of popular genres and how they can affect various activities.
