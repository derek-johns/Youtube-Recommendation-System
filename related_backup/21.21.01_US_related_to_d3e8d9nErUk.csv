This channel began as a personal documentation of my reconstruction experiments, as I endeavoured to learn about the history of humans through how their clothes were worn and constructed. Electric sewing machines aren't really my jam, so I tend to take on garment styles that pre-date WWI, using the hand sewing methods and historical machinery that would have been available at the time, as well as bringing those historical sewing methods into the process of making things for 21st century wear.Making stuff by hand tends to take a while, so between projects you can generally find me here talking about old clothes, looking at old clothes, busting some myths, exploring historical sites, investigating dress-related concepts, experimenting with techniques, historybounding, and introducing you to experts who continue traditional crafts.Have yourself a snack and stay awhile, if you wish. :)","historical dress costume costuming sewing how-to fashion vintage sew costumer reenactment historical dress historical costume period costume historical costume making historical fashion fashion history sewing vlog dress history costume review","d3e8d9nErUk"

The series is the first in a nine-figure Shondaland deal with the streaming service. It adapts Julia Quinn‚Äôs popular romance series, which covers the romantic lives of eight Bridgerton siblings in 19th century England. The series focuses on Daphne Bridgerton and the Duke Simon Basset, played by Phoebe Dynevor and Reg√©-Jean Page. It even features Julie Andrews as the voice of Lady Whistledown, a regency-era ‚ÄúGossip Girl‚Äù writer. While there‚Äôs plenty of jaw-dropping love scenes in the show, the only thing more shocking is all the work that went in behind the scenes. This incredible effort includes a six week boot camp where the cast learned how to dance and ride horses, nine months of filming, and more than 7,000 costumes created by costume designer Ellen Mirojnick.  The stars even worked with a chemistry coordinator to get the romances just right, but the most challenging part of filming will probably surprise you. As for the 200 members of the crew who worked behind the scenes, their most challenging tasks had to do with turning modern mansions into 19th century homes, and creating those grand ballroom scenes. We also have all the details on a possible season two-- both Shonda Rhimes and showrunner Chris Van Dusen are interested-- as well as the possibility of an eight-season series. Here‚Äôs all the behind the scenes ‚ÄúBridgerton‚Äù knowledge you absolutely need to know.

I saw lots of them already, but they all have seemed to show beauty standards in a very stereotypical and pop-culture way, so I wanted to do a more historically accurate one. As I was doing some research, I became more and more aware that beautiful faces and fashion we see on the photos, ads and fashion plates are just an idealistic version of reality. So here's to reality. NOTES:It was hard for me to make this video universal and find some papers referring to the whole Europe or even the whole world, so the numbers I used may be a little misleading. To make it clear:- 40% of women in factories (1901) refers to Great Britain only- one out of nine women working in domestic service refers to Russia.If you know any other specific numbers referring to a wider cultural context I'd be more than greatful.[POLISH] Prawdziwe kobietySzczerze m√≥wiƒÖc, mia≈Ço to byƒá kolejne wideo Piƒôkno przez dziesiƒôciolecia.

However, in this video, I don't actually want to talk about the historical accuracy, or lack thereof, in Netflix's Bridgerton...because I don't actually see the point. What I do want to talk about, is how impressive that they custom built that entire wardrobe department in 5 months, as someone who has worked with supplying TV, Film, and Theatre at my old job, I know, very well, how difficult it can be working in a production's costuming department. I also want to make the larger point about how important Bridgerton is to the broader cosplay/costuming community, how this hating of historical fantasy isn't actually anything new - there were strong responses to Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette (2006) as well as the first season of Outlander when they came out. Bridgerton really isn't anything different. Comparing Bridgerton to the likes of Emma 2020 is, honestly, pointless, because they're not meant to be the same. Basically, the point of this video (other than making a larger Community TV reference üòÇ) is that I want to present a different way of thinking about historical costuming in tv and movies. That not every show or movie is going to focus on historical accuracy, and that historical fantasy is a *good* thing.

BEFORE YOU COMMENT, please re-read the title of the video. It doesn't say Why The Costumes Of Little Women Were Bad; No , they simply didn't measure up to the other Oscar nominees. They didn't do the movie itself any favors. Talented designer, but the execution was messy. It ended up taking a lot of people out of the story while watching. Myself included.You'll hear me rant about the Live Action Beauty And The Beast too, and a couple other vaguely related topics.

Constance's lovely channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_ClFJYwA3lDagY4igPKddg Labor ethics disclaimer from the brand which the corset was purchased: https://www.adidas-group.com/en/sustainability/people/factory-workers/Despite this disclaimer, however, I was unable to find satisfactory evidence to prove that the brand have established contractual requirements with their manufacturers to ensure that the factories commissioned to manufacture products are paying their employees at living wages. Furthermore, I was disappointed to find that this brand is one of the many guilty of cancelling partly- or fully-completed orders this year without paying manufacturers for labor performed. For this reason, I do not endorse this brand and I do consider this purchase to be in violation of my anti-fast fashion endeavors. Though I won‚Äôt be returning the item, as that doesn‚Äôt do anything productive, I will upcycle it into something I can use‚Äîand intend to give the purchase of this garment a net-positive outcome by donating the ad revenue from this video to the Clean Clothes Campaign (https://cleanclothes.org/about), an organisation which is dedicated to improving garment worker rights and conditions worldwide. https://goodonyou.eco/adidas-ethical/2019 report on brands and ethical labor policies/future plans: https://labourbehindthelabel.org/report-tailored-wages-uk-2019/https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/company-profile/adidas-agSOURCES & FOOTNOTES:Due to character limitations, the full page of footnotes can be found here: https://bernadettebanner.co.uk/sports-corsetsGartland, Elizabeth.

When the Girls Came Out to Play: The Birth of American Sportswear. Massachusetts, University of Massachusetts Press, August 2, 2006.*I actually disagree with this; I mean, yes, it *could* probably be worn over another corset, but the advertisement declares that this corselet 'supersedes the corset' and highlights its intention to be worn only on the upper part of the body, allowing for perfect freedom of movement in the lower. I think they've drawn this conclusion because of the strange little buttoned tabs coming out the bottom of it, but the advertisement shows the woman using these tabs to button the waist of her skirt in place. Since the Khiva corselet is very short in length, it wouldn't provide that secure anchor point at the waist that normal, bust-to-hip corsets do.

Hoping to follow in her parent‚Äôs footsteps and find a match sparked by true love, Daphne‚Äôs prospects initially seem to be unrivaled. But as her older brother begins to rule out her potential suitors, the high society scandal sheet written by the mysterious Lady Whistledown (voiced by Julie Andrews) casts aspersions on Daphne. Enter the highly desirable and rebellious Duke of Hastings (Reg√©-Jean Page), committed bachelor and the catch of the season for the debutantes‚Äô mamas. Despite proclaiming that they want nothing the other has to offer, their attraction is undeniable and sparks fly as they find themselves engaged in an increasing battle of wits while navigating society‚Äôs expectations for their future.Bridgerton is a romantic, scandalous, and quick-witted series that celebrates the timelessness of enduring friendships, families finding their way, and the search for a love that conquers all. The series also stars Jonathan Bailey (Anthony Bridgerton‚Äù), Nicola Coughlan (‚ÄúPenelope Featherington‚Äù), Claudia Jessie (‚ÄúEloise Bridgerton‚Äù), Ruby Barker (‚ÄúMarina Thompson‚Äù), Adjoa Andoh (‚ÄúLady Danbury‚Äù), Golda Rosheuvel (‚ÄúQueen Charlotte‚Äù), Luke Thompson (‚ÄúBenedict Bridgerton‚Äù), Luke Newton (‚ÄúColin Bridgerton‚Äù), Ruby Stokes (‚ÄúFrancesca Bridgerton‚Äù), Will Tilston (‚ÄúGregory Bridgerton‚Äù), Florence Hunt (‚ÄúHyacinth Bridgerton‚Äù), Ruth Gemmell (‚ÄúLady Violet Bridgerton‚Äù), Bessie Carter (‚ÄúPrudence Featherington‚Äù), Harriet Cains (‚ÄúPhilipa Featherington‚Äù), Polly Walker (‚ÄúLady Portia Featherington‚Äù), Ben Miller (‚ÄúLord Featherington‚Äù), Sabrina Bartlett (‚ÄúSiena Rosso‚Äù), Martins Imhangbe (‚ÄúWill Mondrich‚Äù), and Lorraine Ashbourne (‚ÄúMrs. Varley‚Äù).","Unleash Your Inner Movie Lover!New videos every week on Netflix, Disney, superheroes, sci-fi, musicals, horror, animation, and more!Join Jan on a Movie-Loving Adventure with deep dives into your favourite films and TV shows.Expect endings explained, easter eggs, film theory, deleted scenes and behind-the-scenes secrets.Yippee-ki-yay, movie lovers!Affiliate links may be included and disclosed in some video descriptions.

Then there are some that promote misconceptions but aren't terrible people. You know, the guys that say follow these tips to get out of the friendzone! They give bad advice, but they're not the worst. Then at the top of the scale, we have guys like Roosh. He has regressive views on gender (to put it lightly) and he promotes dangerous messages with regards to consent. *TW: this video explores r*ape and sexual assault.*-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Chapters:0:00 History & Background3:05 Men & Dating7:45 Bobby Rio11:07 Richard La Ruina14:56 The Attractive Man21:28 Roosh V27:50 TW: sh00tings28:49 TW: r*pe34:21 BBC Undercover36:37 Neil Strauss37:54 Announcement40:18 DOGGY -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ty Turner's video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJEiUMb9C1MAwesome videos on PUAs:Real Feels' 'How Pickup Artists Ruined Dating'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6GcPgV6LeoHbomberguy's 'Pick Up Artistry: A Measured Response'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pEfhgG3Ocw How To Be A Pickup Artist | Ladventures With Thomas Grayhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DTM6aMGItYAmanda the Jedi's 'Pickup Artists are a PLAGUE'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXCemno6970Kurtis Conner's 'The Most Attractive Man on YouTube'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQjNPIuGJg-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Follow my work:Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/taramookneeInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/taramookneeTwitter: @taramooknee-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sources used for this video:History & background on PUAs- https://www.theage.com.au/technology/winging-it-20070129-ge43e2.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2- https://www.businessinsider.com/the-red-pill-reddit-2013-8?r=US&IR=T- https://www.webcitation.org/mainframe.php- https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/game-author-neil-strauss-how-881437Do men think of sex every 2 seconds?- https://www.gq.com/story/health-myth-does-the-average-man-really-think-about-sex-every-7-seconds- https://www.cbsnews.com/news/men-think-about-sex-every-7-seconds-what-study-says/- https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/thinking-about-sex/- https://www.readersdigest.co.uk/health/health-conditions/medical-myths-men-think-about-sex-every-seven-seconds- https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/11/111128132704.htmAdvice from a psychologist on navigating friend zoneshttps://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-sex/nice-guy-syndrome-dating-tactics-persona-men-women-relationships-a7476651.htmlRichard La Ruina on British Women:- https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/4928589/controversial-pick-up-artist-who-slammed-overweight-entitled-british-women-insists-ladies-love-being-chatted-up-street/- https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/shameless-dating-expert-branded-d-11571555Roosh V:- https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/male-supremacy- http://wehuntedthemammoth.com/2015/08/14/are-roosh-vs-bang-books-how-to-guides-for-date-rape/- https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/25/can-someone-please-send-mushrooms-to-all-the-mens-rights-activists-out-there- https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/amazon-removes-books-rape-apologist-roosh_n_5b96ea09e4b0511db3e54945?ri18n=true&guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9jb25zZW50LnlhaG9vLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAH2KL2CMHjVokrwEiKwJ-fRdUM98kp7khKXo94aZCXLLKvKo36tXiRXwZFQMuqRYeJR6VDyDLu--RGEh_XOqa6ZgNHf7QFXvou4kd6Sn3xP3jKDweLE5NS4pg7-ofzRtpvDYlqJyyYowTdmVFRfMdUSKOwnKhYDSmS38rkkiFPDQ- https://www.thedailybeast.com/daryush-valizadeh-the-pick-up-artist-known-as-roosh-says-he-has-found-godBBC Videos: - https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-scotland-49925969- Reggie Yates' Extreme, UK, Men at War - BBC, Three 2015","I make social & political commentary whilst trying to be funny.She/her.Moo. üêÑ","","d3e8d9nErUk"

Electric sewing machines aren't really my jam, so I tend to take on garment styles that pre-date WWI, using the hand sewing methods and historical machinery that would have been available at the time, as well as bringing those historical sewing methods into the process of making things for 21st century wear.Making stuff by hand tends to take a while, so between projects you can generally find me here talking about old clothes, looking at old clothes, busting some myths, exploring historical sites, investigating dress-related concepts, experimenting with techniques, historybounding, and introducing you to experts who continue traditional crafts.Have yourself a snack and stay awhile, if you wish. :)","historical dress costume costuming sewing how-to fashion vintage sew costumer reenactment historical dress historical costume period costume historical costume making historical fashion fashion history sewing vlog dress history costume review","d3e8d9nErUk"

Are they actually...dare I say it...good...or smoking hot garbage?It's common for historical costumers and dress historians to be overly critical and judgmental towards movie costumes, I mean, after all, we spend years and years studying different eras, historical construction techniques, and even sewing our own historical costumes. But a costume designer's job isn't always to be historically accurate, but to help tell a story through their costume designs. Additionally, the pursuit of historical accuracy is a bit of a weird one, because our understanding and knowledge of historic dress change constantly. New research is being published and shared regularly, old myths and ideas debunked, and sources becoming easier to find. The 2005 Pride and Prejudice has had a bit of popularity spike right now, thanks in part to Youtube and Tumblr (holy memes, batman) and it got me to thinking about the costumes. I was quick to dismiss them when the movie first came out, but now, looking back on the film, and rewatching it several times since March (mmm escapism...) I've developed a slightly different opinion. It's not that the costumes are perfect, they're definitely flawed, but that doesn't mean a lot of research into 18th century and regency clothing wasn't done, in fact, when watching the movie, it's clear that Jacquline Durran, the costume designer, did a lot of research into 18th century and Regency era women's fashion and dress. So, with that in mind, I wanted to sit down create a deep dive video essay on the women's costumes from this version of Pride and Prejudice. Let's sit back, relax a bit, discuss, and fact check the costumes from Pride and Prejudice - including *that* brown dress that everyone on the internet is obsessed with.  ü•≥SocialsInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/abbyelynPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/abbycoxüñºImages Used:Gallery of Fashion: https://digital.bunka.ac.jp/kichosho_e/search_list2.phpMorning Dress, 1806, The Met Museum: https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/107969https://whitakerauction.smugmug.com/The-Helen-Larson-Private-Collection/1830s-through-1860s/LOT-126-FRENCH-STRIPED-SILK-GOWN-1780s-RESTYLED-c-1815/i-pwLpC9Phttps://www.1stdibs.com/art/paintings/portrait-paintings/thomas-philips-portrait-madame-de-mont-vert/id-a_989053/https://www.wikiart.org/en/jacques-louis-david/robertine-tourteau-marquise-d-orvilliers-1790https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/98071https://emuseum.history.org/objects/69696/dress?ctx=f92e3e32d12e1f6c61d6f3cef7171fc5aec12ab3&idx=136https://emuseum.history.org/objects/413/dresshttps://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/107986https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/437581https://emuseum.history.org/objects/58308/portrait-of-clarissa-partridge-ide-childs-mrs-asa-childs?ctx=9bc71c66cc6c9dd43998d605c0a1c07c71a57bec&idx=46https://emuseum.history.org/objects/105024/portrait-of-sarah-stratton-nivison-mrs-john-nivison-1756?ctx=7187b2b112e248b458eebf4754055345d454ab06&idx=40http://www.nationaltrustcollections.org.uk/object/1350407https://findit.library.yale.edu/catalog/digcoll:951304üì∏My Video Kit:Camera: https://amzn.to/2AKyToyLens: https://amzn.to/375FOow Mic: https://amzn.to/2z5mtXY üíåBusiness Inquiries *ONLY* abbycox@semaphorebrands.com(This email goes directly to my management and not to me.)üé∂Music via Epidemic Sound (https://www.epidemicsound.com)**I am a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for me to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.

The show was directed by Shonda Rhimes and chases around the Bridgertons, the Featheringtons, Queen Charlotte, the Duke of Hastings, & Lady Danbury as they romance and intertwine their lives, and as far as the show goes I had a good time watching it. I liked it so much that I started to make a video about the show, but realized that the show is nowhere near historically accurate when it comes to its garments! But luckily, I found that the showrunners and costume designer had no desire to make the show historically accurate, which made it a really fun mishmash of styles and references that were diverse and cool to explore! So let's talk about Daphne, the Duke, Anthony, Penelope, Marina, Lady Featherthington, Lady Bridgerton, Queen Charlotte, Lady Danbury & more in this exploration of the show!Headwraps: Then, There, & Now: https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/hairstyles/the-history-of-headwraps-then-there-and-nowJoin this channel to get access to perks:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoEj4uRzynPXEEegNqMnJVw/joinSocial Media:Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/hautelemode/Personal Style: https://www.instagram.com/hautelemess/For business inquiries please contact: hautelemode@ellifyagency.comVideo Edited by:Rachel Fritz: https://www.instagram.com/rachelfritz/","Fashion communtur and meme queen.

Many garments will go years between wears, leading to frustration when we discover they no longer fit. I've been amassing self-made costumes and clothing for almost 20 years at this point, and many of my favorite pieces never see the light of day for this reason! As I've started to pull older garments out to use as examples in my videos, I've seen a number of comments about their poor fit. As ideal as it would be that they fit me like they did 5 or 10 years ago, it's just not feasible. Even with as fast as I sew, I can't make a whole new ensemble every time I need something. And nor should I! I do try to alter my garments when I am able to, but again, I'm fortunate enough to have the time, knowledge, and extra fabric to do so! But alterations aren't always a possibility and certainly aren't always a perfect fix. Antique clothing often shows evidence of hasty or unskilled alterations. Or of times where clothing wasn't altered and was pulled and stressed to the point of busting seams or closures! If it's so normal that their clothing wasn't a perfect fit, then why do we always expect ours to be? I see alteration as a way to care for my clothing and myself, but it's not done with the expectation of having a perfect wardrobe. My body is a living thing, and my clothing can't change that fast!So, let's take a step back and look at forms of commentary that come along with issues like body changes or skill growth. It's important to understand that, even under the most helpful of intentions, these sorts of comments can be damaging. Sharing advice and knowledge is essential in this community.

Many garments will go years between wears, leading to frustration when we discover they no longer fit. I've been amassing self-made costumes and clothing for almost 20 years at this point, and many of my favorite pieces never see the light of day for this reason! As I've started to pull older garments out to use as examples in my videos, I've seen a number of comments about their poor fit. As ideal as it would be that they fit me like they did 5 or 10 years ago, it's just not feasible. Even with as fast as I sew, I can't make a whole new ensemble every time I need something. And nor should I! I do try to alter my garments when I am able to, but again, I'm fortunate enough to have the time, knowledge, and extra fabric to do so! But alterations aren't always a possibility and certainly aren't always a perfect fix. Antique clothing often shows evidence of hasty or unskilled alterations. Or of times where clothing wasn't altered and was pulled and stressed to the point of busting seams or closures! If it's so normal that their clothing wasn't a perfect fit, then why do we always expect ours to be? I see alteration as a way to care for my clothing and myself, but it's not done with the expectation of having a perfect wardrobe. My body is a living thing, and my clothing can't change that fast!So, let's take a step back and look at forms of commentary that come along with issues like body changes or skill growth. It's important to understand that, even under the most helpful of intentions, these sorts of comments can be damaging. Sharing advice and knowledge is essential in this community. However, there is a time and place for learning and a time and place for celebration! So let's ask for advice and be open to it when we're struggling, when we are ready to learn and grow.

Some of the ladies from the Inclusion in costuming panel that we did for CoCoVid this summer came and asked me if we could perhaps record another video for you all to discuss the problematic nature of the show Bridgerton, which has pretty much everyone talking right now, for one reason or another. We would like to talk about colorism, race baiting, and implicit bias in Bridgerton, but also in modern television media today.If you don‚Äôt know what Bridgerton is, its is a show produced by Shonda Rhimes for Netflix and is based off of a book series and it is billed as an inclusively cast period drama set in the late regency era.Let me be clear, we aren‚Äôt here to trash the show. A bunch of people on this panel actually really like the show. What we did want to discuss is why calling this show ‚Äúinclusive‚Äù is problematic. We are not here to tell you that you shouldn't enjoy this show, just that you may want to take a hard look at it as an example of the systematic biases that modern media engenders. This panel is meant to serve similarly to when you tell your friend that they do something that bothers you and they ask you to point it out the next time it happens.We have a live and topical example here of what is meant by problematic themes and casting in popular media and we thought we could use it to exemplify some of the things that we, as a country, have been discussing in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement this year.When it comes to topics of race and inclusion, I believe that it is my job, as a compassionate human to make space for People of Color to let their opinions be heard. While I agree with all of their points, I don‚Äôt believe that It really matters how I feel about it. My job is to make space and to hear them. I am going to set some ground rules to please be kind, and generous, as you always are, in the comments section. I‚Äôd also like to mention that this video will probably be full of spoilers, so if you are a person who wants to watch the show spoiler free, feel free to come back and join us for this conversation later.**Links mentioned in this video**Inclusion in the Costuming Community - https://youtu.be/b3tdjRLBcdoAnnenberg Inclusion Initiative USC - https://annenberg.usc.edu/research/aiiHarvard Implicit Bias Test - https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.htmlRefinery 29 Article - https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/12/10240235/bridgerton-review-blackness-representation **Further Reading**https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/18/arts/television/bridgerton-netflix-shonda-rhimes.html?smtyp=cur&smid=tw-nytimes https://search.proquest.com/openview/f42e756daa93638c5c9e1ee880830835/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y **We  hear from the voices of**Anne of https://www.instagram.com/silkenstitches     https://www.etsy.com/shop/SilkenStitchesShop     https://m.facebook.com/silkenstitches/     https://www.paypal.me/silkenstitches     https://ko-fi.com/silkenstitchesNami of https://www.instagram.com/namisparrow     https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMs7vu9Hpf9082sxlMW4h6A     GoodReads: Nami Sparow     https://ko-fi.com/nekonamiGiGI of https://www.instagram.com/reenactorsofcolor and      https://www.instagram.com/labelladonnahistory     https://fleurtyherald.wordpress.com/about/     https://www.paypal.me/Coulsons     https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe1Izj92BXlpjlCZbykKqVAChristine of https://www.instagram.com/sewstine     https://sewstine.com/     https://www.etsy.com/shop/SewVeryStineErika of https://www.instagram.com/erikaalamode     https://erikaalamode.wordpress.com/     https://ko-fi.com/erikaalamodeMaria of https://www.instagram.com/historicalgarments     https://ko-fi.com/historicalgarments‚òÖFollow Me!‚òÖMy Patreon - https://www.patreon.com/CostumingDramaMy Costuming Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/costuming_drama/My Personal Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/lbc42/My Cats' Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/gatosdepaduan/My Ko-Fi - https://ko-fi.com/costumingdrama","Hi!

When I was making the brown jumper dress, I realized I had never really given the costumes in the film much thought, but that I did determinately like them much better than the 'typical' Regency seen in other Jane Austen adaptations. This is clearly because the goal with this was to be set in the transitional (and sorry for the amount of times I used this work in the video) period of the late 1790s and early 1800s. There is evidence that Jane Austen wrote the early draft of Pride and Prejudice, called First Impressions, in the late 1790s. So I thought it might be fun to hear from someone who knows very little to nothing about the Regency period! I thought this was a good chance to dress up and have a look at these costumes and also explore a little bit more about this time period that I know so little about. Let me know down below if you like these costumes or if you prefer the more Regency look!Enchanted Rose Costumes' great video on Regency things: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3qfmdjDaa4If you are interested in seeing some more of my work, here are some links:Please consider supporting me on Patreon, www.patreon.com/catscostumery :)    Instagram: @katisinthebag    https://www.instagram.com/katisinthebag/    Blog: https://happilyevertaffeta.wordpress.com    Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/catscostumery/    Ko-fi: https://ko-fi.com/V7V7HRLNFor business inquiries, email catscostumery@gmail.com","Sewing, stitching and stuff.Hi!

How on earth do we go on admiring and happily sewing clothes from a history that's laced with racism and injustice?I've been thinking hard about this myself, since as I'm sure you are aware, there's more to the Peacock dress than pretty metallic embroidery.This week, I want to share more about the historical landscape in which the Peacock dress was designed, made, and worn - including a potential connection to my own ancestors - and if I may, I'd like to share the thoughts of one insignificant, white, middle class woman about where we might go from here as people recreating these clothes.I think there IS something important that we can contribute - in fact, I think we have a small but highly relevant part to play in helping to create a better world.I hope you'll let me know what you think.Footnotes: apologies that most of these are Wikipedia links, I'm still early in this journey.1 - First Indian War of Independence, 1857 / Rebellion: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Rebellion_of_18572 - Britain in India: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_British_Raj3 - Muslin: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslin#History4 - Dr Shashi Tharoor on what Britain owes to India: https://youtu.be/f7CW7S0zxv4Further reading: this has been my first port of call...An Era of Darkness: The British Empire in India by Shashi TharoorImages:- Thumbnail: Muslim Lady Reclining or An Indian Girl with a Hookah, painted in Dacca, Bengal Presidency.

I offer no formal qualifications in this area, just personal experience and more than a quarter century of obsessive independent study, but I hope to help you as a friend - and a voice of sanity in a demanding world.When I'm sewing, I love to reverse engineer and recreate the clothing of the late Victorian and Edwardian eras so that it can step out of the glass museum case and live again.

The adults aren‚Äôt the only ones rediscovering old friendships in Smallville as the Kent sons are reacquainted with Lana and Kyle‚Äôs rebellious daughter, Sarah (Inde Navarrette, ‚ÄúWander Darkly‚Äù). Of course, there‚Äôs never a dull moment in the life of a superhero, especially with Lois‚Äô father, General Samuel Lane (Dylan Walsh, ‚ÄúNip/Tuck‚Äù) looking for Superman to vanquish a villain or save the day at a moment‚Äôs notice.

usEZrFE3ZzM,"Were Muslims too nomadic, busy, & primitive for a Qur'an?","UC-wOxG8p_Nk5nFkSxZOxq6w","PfanderFilms","24","526.0","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/usEZrFE3ZzM/default.jpg","[none]","A Muslim viewer, Mohammed ibn Dawud, has a number of interesting misconceptions of Islam and the Qu'ran's beginnings. He says, Jay, I understand your hypothesis: Christians in their early centuries were persecuted and poor (in money) so they could only afford papyrus (and they wrote in secret), yet, Muslims were wealthy and had access and money for parchments (and they had the control of the area).¬† However, this does not answer Dr. David Wood‚Äôs 1) ‚ÄòToo Busy Hypothesis‚Äô that the early Muslims were conquering so fast and violently so they did not have time for writing the Quran.¬† I would add to Wood‚Äôs ‚ÄòToo Busy Hypothesis‚Äô that (as the narrative states) the early Muslims were from the Hejaz where: 2) the community were nomadic; the language was primitive (rasm); and, the culture was vocal rather than textual.¬† This point is reinforced with the Muslim Apologists argument of ‚Äò recitation‚Äò, which could/could not have some truth in it (we don‚Äôt know either way because there is no tangible evidence). Could it be that David Wood is right with his ‚ÄòToo Busy Hypothesis‚Äô AND you [Dr. Jay Smith] are also right with the Uthman Quran being a fabrication (i.e. retrospective fiction)? You seem to be concluding 3) that if the Uthman Qurans are false, then the 7th century narrative was false.¬† Is that a correct assumption?My response is five-fold:1) The idea that the early Muslims were just ‚ÄúToo Busy‚Äù to write a Qur'an down is superfluous, since it‚Äôs right there in their own traditions, in Al Bukhari 6:509-510, which states that the Qur'an was first written in 632, and then rewritten in 652, and sent to 5 cities. Yet, where are any of them? 2) The traditions also state that the Muslims weren‚Äôt nomadic by the time the Qur'an they claim was written down, and had a caliphate in Medina from 624 onward, and controlled cities from Tripoli in the West to Afghanistan in the East, all of which had very literate people living in them. 3) Was the Arabic language too primitive. The language was indeed primitive, but they still wrote a primitive text, according to their traditions; and this text may have only included 16 Rasm (consonantal) letters; yet, where is it? 4) Concerning a recited Qur'an; where is there reference for this recited Qur‚Äôan, since everything we read in the traditions suggest that the reason they had to write it down was due to the weaknesses of a recited text. Furthermore, where is there any proof of its ongoing existence since the 7th century? 5) If there are no MSS for any Qur‚Äôans from the 7th century (or any evidence for Muhammad, Mecca, the Caliphs, Muslims, or even Islam), then I would maintain that it is the 9th-10th century traditional narratives which may be the problem, suggesting that those traditions are possibly false, which, unsurprisingly, has been my conclusion for years now.¬© Pfander Centre for Apologetics - US, 2020(44,720) new-sky-by Rafael Krux-from filmmusic-io","Pfander Films primary interest is the study and explanation of all issues related to Islam.We will post video comments on youtube videos with Islamic/Christian themes, as well as new short talks on varoius subjects around this issue.","Pfander Centre for Apologetics Jay Smith Beth Grove Hatun Tash Sarah Foster Speakers Corner Hyde Park debates Qur'an Allah Koran Islam Muslim Christian ministry","d3e8d9nErUk"
