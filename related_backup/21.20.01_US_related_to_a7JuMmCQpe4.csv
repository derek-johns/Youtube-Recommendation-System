They make more money than any other person in the dealership for a very good reason. They are sharks, and they are NOT looking out for you. They are looking out for themselves and the interests of their dealership. When they shop your car deal to many different banks, they are looking for the bank that allows them to pack the most product into your car deal. When you start seeing bank names like Santander, Capital One, Chase, Wells Fargo, Regional Acceptance Corporation, Ally... you know you're sitting in a car dealers finance office.

All the details on HOW TO BUY A CAR, TRUCK, or SUV.This video was published to help you discover how you can save time and money on your next new or used car purchase by doing your homework first, and then going car shopping as an informed buyer.  We are more than amused by a few of the car salespeople or car dealers who contact us and state that we are making a 'small problem' sound far worse than it is. We know there are honest people in the car business, but it's definitely a buyer beware world out on the car lot! If you watched the video Confessions of a car dealers backroom you understand why you need to see this video. By understanding what mistakes to avoid, you'll not only become a smarter car buyer, but you'll also better understand what not to tell a car dealer when buying a car. It's true that you can play all your cards up front with an honest dealer, but unfortunately, they represent the minority of dealer owners (truly transparent and honest dealers make up about 40% of all dealers), and you are unlikely to know the difference until it's far too late. Be smart, do your homework, and you'll come home with a car deal that's good for you and the dealer. After all, that's what fairness is all about. We encourage you to be fair and honest.
