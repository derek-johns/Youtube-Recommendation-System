From driving cars to using cell phones, these are the rules that former presidents have to follow.One of the greatest perks of being president is not having to deal with traffic every day. For one thing, you've got drivers who can take you anywhere you need to go, and for another, the Secret Service can block off traffic for you to ensure your security. It's no fun for anyone else on the road, but hey, you're the president, and you have important things to do.There is a downside, though. Once a president's term is over, they can never drive a car on an open road again. The reason is because of the lifetime Secret Service detail that all ex-presidents get. After all, one of the least safe places you can be is on the road, and that's just under normal circumstances. Add in that ex-presidents are always a target, and things get even hairier. So, to ensure their safety, they're not allowed to hit the road.As George W. Bush explained to Jay Leno, he's only allowed to drive on his own private property, far from any reckless drivers or people who wish him harm. He must be driven everywhere by Secret Service agents trained in evasive and defensive driving maneuvers. The rule was instituted after John F. Kennedy's assassination in 1963. Lyndon B. Johnson was, to date, the last president to drive on public roads.Watch the video for more Rules Former Presidents Have To Follow!#Presidents #POTUSNo driving | 0:00Updates for life | 1:19Mandatory library | 2:34Bigger Brother | 3:44Mail screening for life | 5:01Never alone | 6:09All the small things | 7:18Opting out | 8:40Read full article: https://www.grunge.com/190417/rules-former-presidents-have-to-follow/","The world is pretty weird...in fact, it's a whole lot weirder than you think.

The mob coursed through the building, enraged that Congress was preparing to make Trump’s electoral defeat official. “Drag them out! … Hang them out!” rioters yelled at one point, as they gathered near the House chamber.Officials in the House and Senate secured the doors of their respective chambers, but lawmakers were soon forced to retreat to undisclosed locations. Five people died on the grounds that day, including a Capitol police officer. In all, more than 50 officers were injured.To reconstruct the pandemonium inside the Capitol, The Washington Post examined text messages, photos and hundreds of videos, some of which were exclusively obtained. By synchronizing the footage and locating some of the camera angles within a digital 3-D model of the building, The Post was able to map the rioters’ movements and assess how close they came to lawmakers — in some cases feet apart or separated only by a handful of vastly outnumbered police officers.

And more than a dozen US Capitol Police officers are under internal investigation for allegedly helping rioters.While President Donald Trump's role in inciting the violence is clear, there are some early indications and accusations that other insiders may have more actively aided the mob.Ali Alexander, a right-wing conspiracy theorist who led one of the Stop The Steal groups, claimed in a livestream video that he planned the rally that preceded the riot with three GOP lawmakers: Reps. Paul Gosar and Andy Biggs of Arizona, and Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama.Brooks spoke at the rally before Trump took the stage, and urged the crowd to start taking down names and kicking ass. In a 2,800-word statement about his involvement, Brooks said he was only telling the crowd to fight back at the ballot box. (Brooks also revealed that a White House official called him one day earlier and invited him to speak at the rally.)CNN previously reported that Gosar associated himself with Alexander's group in recent months. A spokesman for Biggs told CNN that he hasn't ever met or worked with Alexander.Alexander said he hoped his mob would pressure lawmakers to block President-elect Joe Biden's victory through the Electoral College. After the riot was quelled, the three lawmakers voted to throw out Biden's electoral votes from Arizona and Pennsylvania. Their effort failed.#CNN #News","CNN operates as a division of Turner Broadcasting System, which is a subsidiary of Warner Media.

It did not reckon with Trump's role in fomenting that violence, nor did it contain a vow to change his behavior.But with 13 days until Biden is inaugurated, the President's comments in a prerecorded video amounted to as much of a concession as he is likely to offer before he departs the White House for good.A new administration will be inaugurated on January 20, Trump said in the video, which was taped at the White House. My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power.A White House adviser in discussions with senior officials said Trump recorded the video only because his presidency is threatened by looming resignations and potential impeachment.I think that video was done only because almost all his senior staff was about to resign, and impeachment is imminent, the adviser said.#ErinBurnett #CNN #News","CNN operates as a division of Turner Broadcasting System, which is a subsidiary of Warner Media.

A sea of 200,000 flags on the National Mall will stand in for the normally vast crowd cheering a new commander in chief.And while Biden is using his inauguration to highlight “America United,” he faces a nation where many Republicans still reject his victory, including outgoing President Donald Trump -- who Biden’s fellow Democrats and a handful of Republicans impeached for a second time last week despite Biden’s misgivings about the message it would send as he ascended to the presidency.Subscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2TwO8GmBloomberg Quicktake brings you live global news and original shows spanning business, technology, politics and culture.

Harris learned Tuesday that he will be released early from prison on Trump’s orders, though the White House has not yet publicly said so. The music and marijuana mogul was told of the decision Sunday and said he wanted to share a message with the outgoing president.“That’s great work for the president and his team on the way out, ” Snoop Dogg said in remarks shared with The Post.“They did some great work while they was in there and they did some great work on their way out. Let them know that I love what they did. ”He also said, “It is amazing what the work of God can actually bring to life to make people understand that there is a God. ”Snoop Dogg praised Trump on a Zoom call with reform advocates Alice Johnson and Weldon Angelos, who shared the recording with his permission. The Zoom meeting was convened so that Johnson could break the news to Snoop Dogg that Harris, 59, would be getting clemency after three decades in prison for attempted murder and cocaine trafficking. His was slated for release in June 2028.“Happy Sunday” Snoop Dogg says, before hearing the purpose for the Zoom call. Johnson, the first-time drug offender Trump freed from a life sentence, following lobbying by Kim Kardashian and later pardoned, then shared the news. Johnson tells Snoop Dogg, “I just got a call from the White House and Harry-O is getting clemency. He’s coming home, brother! ”Snoop exclaims, “God is good! ”A thrilled Johnson concurs, “All the time! All the time! All the time! ”Harris received word he’d been granted clemency at Lompoc Federal Correctional Institution in California, said Angelos, who received his own pardon from Trump in December. Angelos said Harris sent him an email saying, “Thank God. God is great. It feels like the weight of the world was lifted off my shoulders. ”Snoop’s efforts came even though he’s been an outspoken critic of Trump — and even made a video in which he pretended to shoot a clown dressed as the president. Angelos credited first daughter Ivanka Trump for Harris’ impending release more than seven years before it was scheduled to take place on June 13, 2028.“The credit on this one goes to Ivanka Trump because Ivanka Trump was not going to take no for an answer, ” he said. He said Ivanka “did this for Alice Johnson and this is a huge win for hip-hop. ”All data is taken from the source: http://nypost.comArticle Link: https://nypost.com/2021/01/19/i-love-what-they-did-snoop-dogg-on-trump-granting-clemency-to-pal-harry-o/#trump #newsheadlines #bbcworldnewstoday #newstodaylocal #kingworldnews #newstodaycnn #","","news nytimes cnn news msn news cbs news breitbart news cnn breaking news las vegas news san diego news news4jax npr news channel 7 news carteret news times dalton daily citizen daytona news journal mitchell daily republic sandesh epaper lasalle news tribune wltx news 19 tesfanews news herald downriver news gazette obituaries lynchburg news and advance waukegan news sun newsadvance drudge news fox 5 news las vegas lex18 news knx 1070 kfox news lincoln ne news jackson ms news fox 4 news kc picayune item wltx news news 4 okc","6Lj_JVKt-sg"

Prime ministers and presidents around the world urged US president Donald Trump and his supporters to accept the result of November’s presidential election. President-elect Joe Biden’s administration is set to be inaugurated in 14 days. The US Congress on Thursday certified Biden as the next president, while a statement from Trump promised an “orderly transition” to a new administration even though “I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out.”“A fundamental rule of democracy is that, after elections, there are winners and losers,” said Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel. “Both have to play their role with decency and responsibility so that democracy itself remains the winner.”Merkel said Trump had “not conceded his defeat since November, and that has prepared the atmosphere in which such violent events are possible”. Germany’s foreign minister Heiko Maas urged the president and his supporters to “finally accept the decision of the American voters and stop trampling democracy”. The German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, denounced the scenes as “the result of lies and yet more lies, of division and contempt for democracy, of hatred and rabble-rousing, including from the very highest level”. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, confirmed his country’s “friendship and faith” to the US, adding that what had happened in Washington was “not America, definitely. We believe in the strength of our democracies, we believe in the strength of American democracy.”The French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian condemned the violence perpetrated against American public institutions as “a grave attack on democracy”, saying: “I condemn it. The will and the vote of the American people must be respected.”Nato secretary general and former Norwegian prime minister Jens Stoltenberg tweeted that the outcome of the election “must be respected”, warning that “the world is watching”, while Sweden’s premier Stefan Lofven said Trump and “many members of Congress bear significant responsibility for what’s taking place”. Charles Michel, the president of the European council, tweeted: “The US Congress is a temple of democracy. To witness tonight’s scenes in Washington DC is a shock. We trust the US to ensure a peaceful transfer of power to Joe Biden.”In protests described as the greatest threat to US democracy since the civil war, Trump loyalists stormed the the Capitol building seeking to block the certification of the presidential election held in November, temporarily halting the vote. Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, said the extraordinary scenes “must be called out for what it is: a deliberate assault on Democracy by a sitting President & his supporters, attempting to overturn a free & fair election”.
