And through the years, he amassed 14 X Games competition appearances, including three bronze medals, three silver medals and three gold medals. Scotty's riding signaled a sea change in BMX Park riding at X Games. Before he took gold in 2006, only three other riders had ever won gold in BMX Park. Then came Scotty leading a new wave of riders that did serious battle for over a decade. It was always edge-of-your-seat competition when Scotty took to the course. From turndown frontflips to ninja walk drops over unique taco configurations on the course, Scotty did it all, with a smile on his face (after he was done competing of course...)Here, we assembled all of Scotty's gold medal runs from his competition years at X.

The course we designed this time around was more drawn out with less turns but had so many different and difficult obstacles including a rail ride over a pool, a pallet island connected by 2 x 10s, a gap to a sketchy teeter totter, a fake challenge out of the back of a trailer, a jump over a tweaker, another gap over a kiddy pool, and for the last and final obstacle we had a launch ramp over the top of my 2016 Subaru WRX STI! The boys were trying their hardest to get their place on the podium but this time didn't get any easier than the first obstacle course challenge!Especially for Big Boy and the tire ride over the water! We had so much fun and we are going to keep building new courses to ride for you all!

The outcome was amazing! We all gave it our best shot, took some crashes but in the end only one person could be the champion! The scariest part of the course was the final jump that involved a jump over a concrete wall and a chain link using nothing but a couple scrap pieces of wood!

Big Boy started the session off with a flair challenge and then tried to do this pretty crazy street style bunny hop gap and it did not go as planned! But it made for great footage! Matty took a really bad crash in the bowl and he knocked the wind out of himself and gave us all a real scare.. Matty was a trooper and he actually still rode the rest of the day. I had so much fun riding the park and I ended up getting a bunch of tricks done that I was really proud of!

We build a slopestyle trail with MTB Hopper ramps, send it on dirt jump bikes then hit some urban freeride lines, would you ride these ramps? We set up 4 different portable MTB Hopper Kicker ramps down a hill in Southend, Essex and created our own little slopestyle line. The course started off by jumping over a small fence before heading down the hill into a number of different sized ramps to catch some ultimate airtime on our dirt jump mountain bikes. The ramps were a perfect size to throw down tricks and get some good height but small enough to throw in the van and be easy to move around which is really good for fast in and out's. We had a good crew involved for this one with some socially distanced riding and some big GoPro POV trains down our new line and I'm already so excited to do it again somewhere similar. Unfortunately our friends in luminous jackets turned up and told us to leave in the most polite way possible, so we moved on to a new location and set up a single ramp for a quick shred session. After exhausting the fun of the ramp we decided to ditch the ramps and pedal into town to find some more urban MTB freeride lines on our bikes and of course we ended up finding some sick stairs to blast down and steep freeride hills to blast! In the end this turned out to be one of the best session's and i'm already excited for the next ultimate slopestyle course to come to reality! I hope you enjoy the video!MERCH:https://www.tothesky.store/----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Welcome to my channel, I'm a professional Freeride Mountain biker and former FMB world champion(2013).  This channel is all about Mountain biking, I make a huge variety of videos for everyone who loves dirt: From downhill biking to slower paced trials riding and everything in between like dirt jumping, slopestyle and enduro!  As well as making entertaining videos(I hope) I also like to help YOU out too, with videos such as:  - How to ride better - Trick tips and How to's - Travel VLOGS - GoPro camera tips - In-depth entertaining features - POV craziness - Funny videos  I also try to reply to everyone so leave some comments too!","Welcome to my channel, I'm a professional Freeride Mountain biker and former FMB world champion(2013).
