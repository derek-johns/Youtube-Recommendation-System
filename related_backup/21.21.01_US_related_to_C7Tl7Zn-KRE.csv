So we went to Rotiform to find out what it takes to make a good wheel....and a horrible wheel. There have been many notoriously bad wheel designs throughout the last few decades. We pulled from one of the most iconic of this group to create what we now call the Aint Care Bear.  Jason from Rotiform had it machined on the spot, we wrapped it in Toyo Proxes rubber, and then gave it a proper Hoonigan style break-in. Its ridiculous, its dumb, but its also kind of awesome if you're into that sort of thing.

His skill and car control became quickly apparent and Block aptly nabbed Rookie of the Year that season in the Rally America Championship. Since then, Block has also won 25+ national level rallies around the globe, scored points in the WRC, and accumulated five X Games medals...including winning silver on three wheels at X Games in LA in 2012 (behind 9-time WRC champ Sebastien Loeb). In addition to his performance in the car, Block has been a driving force in shedding light on the sport of rally within the United States. His keen branding and marketing acumen, combined with his talents and skills behind the wheel, has also allowed Block to achieve global fame as a rally driver through his wildly successful Gymkhana series of videos. A franchise which has garnered over 600 million views on Youtube alone.  Adding Climbkhana and Terrakhana to the franchises of videos in recent years, Block‚Äôs media properties continue to bring in new fans.","Ken Block Ken Block Gymkhana Hoonicorn Hoonitruck Ken Block Mustang Rally Rally racing","C7Tl7Zn-KRE"

The recent interest in food, combined with a large amount of 'misinformation' has driven me to start this channel.  I hope to be someone people can relate to and trust when they question how their food is grown and raised.  I also hope to become a 'smarter' farmer through my experiences with this channel.  I strongly believe we must have an open mind and a willingness to learn about others, or we cannot move forward as one.  My goal is to build the connection between farmers and consumers by facilitating a collaborative conversation amongst everyone.  I do this by sharing my day-to-day farming experiences, my opinions on certain topics, and occasionally visiting other farms and businesses to help better understand other farming and business practices.
