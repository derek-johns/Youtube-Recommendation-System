I collect the footage at the end of the week and do my voiceover which is why everything I say is in past tense! I always prefer to plan ahead~Q: How do you use so many planners at the same time?A: Every week, I choose a few planners for me to use so I’m not actually using ALL of my planners every single week! For example, I always choose a planner for me to take on the go, one for academics, one for business, and one that is more decorative and fun. Part of what I do is showcasing spread ideas so that is why I have so different layouts!Q: How did you learn your lettering?A: This is a pretty annoying answer but...practice practice practice! I didn’t use a book or a single resource to learn. I honestly just picked up on the different types of lettering through my daily life (things like book covers, posters, etc.) and practiced whenever possible!!!#2021bulletjournal #bulletjournal #bulletjournalsetup","Just a bunch of stationery fanatics :)","planners planning sticker shop thecoffeemonsterzco","EXb3ZZkmxGY"

I'm so excited to start the new bujo year with this Cozy Wintery Monthly Setup! This theme definitely offers some challenge for the more advanced painters and bullet journalers, but still has many easier decorations and elements you could corporate in more minimal themes as well. I wanted to focus on some planning pages to get the yearly goals integrated into these monthly pages too, but otherwise, I think this was a more decoration heavy theme. I wanted to set up a very simple weekly layout, that will be super easy to set up in the middle of the month as well. I feel like setting up the weekly pages has been my biggest bullet journal struggle recently... :DAll in all, I really hope you enjoy this January 2021 Plan With Me and have a beautiful and calm Holiday Season wherever you are ❤ See you again next year!The video is sponsored by Reflectly!------------------------------♦ THEMES, STICKERS, AND PRINTS FOR PURCHASE ♦- My NEW online shop:https://www.annalandeendesigns.comHere you can find stickers, art prints, digital download versions of my themes, and other digital download products! ^^However, please never feel like you need to buy anything from me to show support!

This theme has been so highly requested and I thought why not give it a go on this Halloween season. ^^This was definitely one of the most challenging bullet journal setup I've ever created (I feel like I say that every month), so all the pages are probably not the most functional, but I still hope you'll have fun creating all these decorations. ^^I hope you're staying safe and well and enjoy this October plan with me video!LINK TO THE WIZARDING WORLD WEBSITE (where you can figure out your Hogwarts house, wand and Patronus):- https://www.wizardingworld.com------------------------------♦ THEMES, STICKERS, AND PRINTS FOR PURCHASE ♦- My NEW online shop:https://www.annalandeendesigns.comHere you can find stickers, art prints, digital download versions of my themes, and other digital download products! ^^However, please never feel like you need to buy anything from me to show support!

My 2021 Bullet Journal Setup took a lot longer this year because I have quite a bit of spreads I wanted to try out for the next year.I've taken a bit of a hiatus from bullet journaling the last couple years due to my infertility treatments, but I was able to still journal here and there. This allowed me to try other systems before committing to one that I think I'm going to really like.For this video, you'll see me set up all the spreads I plan to use this year, in real time (which means no time lapse) hence the lengthy video. I also just purchased Final Cut Pro X, so I can now record voice overs. This is a chatty one, but I figured you guys will be setting up your spreads along with me.» CHAPTERS00:00 Introduction04:20 Cover Page11:30 Grid & Key18:04 Year in Photos20:06 Year at a Glance24:24 Future Log26:21 2021 Goals29:39 Ideal Day, Week, Month32:14 Master Task List36:48 Year Trackers40:43 Books Read42:09 Social Media Growth Tracker46:39 Finances & Savings49:30 Youtube, Business & Patreon Planning53:02 Quotes56:17 Flip-Through» FOLLOW MEInstagram: @camiscottageTwitter: @camiscottageFacebook: http://facebook.com/camiscottage» PRODUCTS* Note: Some of these items contain amazon affiliate links where I get a bit of money back if you choose to purchase from these links, at no additional cost to you :)Archer & Olive A5 Dot Grid White Pages Beige › https://bit.ly/3ozMnaB Acacia Organizer › https://amzn.to/2IBVQysCanvas Pencil Case › https://amzn.to/3lxoXBoAlphabet Typewriter Stamps › https://amzn.to/3n04qoUEnglish Alphabet 2pcs › https://amzn.to/3hprqg8Binder Clips › https://amzn.to/3hr4AEVTombow Dual Brush Pens (Pastel) › https://amzn.to/38HyYbRSennelier Watercolor Tubes › https://amzn.to/2M8MfRhDa Vinci Watercolors › https://bit.ly/3814QaFFinetec Pearl Watercolor Paint › https://amzn.to/2WWtFOASakura Pigma Micron 005 › https://amzn.to/3rBXfqBFaber Castell Pencil Eraser › https://amzn.to/37WtwB2Westcott 6-inch Transparent Ruler › https://amzn.to/3o0EXgFPlastic Straight Ruler 12 inches Clear › https://amzn.to/3htfZDZ12 Well Porcelain Mini Mixing Tray Palette with Cover › https://amzn.to/3rHtdSgPrinceton Round Synthetic Squirrel Size 6 Brush › https://amzn.to/3aPGzWRUniBall Signo Gold Gel Pen › https://amzn.to/3hUIhHN» OTHER VIDEOSCheck out my other haul videos for a closer look at some of the supplies used in this video🎄 STATIONERY HAUL | AliExpress Victorian Garden Vintage Theme + Journal with Mehttps://youtu.be/uPTobN3j4HI✒️  STATIONERY HAUL | Traveler's Notebook Bullet Journalhttps://youtu.be/Vgx6bdUxyTE» CREDITSMusic by Epidemic SoundEdited on Final Cut Pro X» EQUIPMENTCanon EOS M50 - https://amzn.to/2MfaSvFCanon G7 X Mark II - https://amzn.to/3rO4MCLBrackets - https://amzn.to/2X8hpKJClamp - https://amzn.to/38RpIjBManfrotto Camera Arm - https://amzn.to/3pAFJkERing Light - https://amzn.to/3pEdSjJ","JOURNAL * ART * GARDEN // I’m a new mom with a passion for journaling, illustration and gardening.
