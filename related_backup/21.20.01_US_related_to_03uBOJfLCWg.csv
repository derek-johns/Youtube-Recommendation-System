Today I am going to be painting and customizing a pair of shoes. They are some cheap knock offs of Vans, but still. They came out really cute. I really enjoyed this process, it was really fun, and there are so many possibilities, especially if you are willing to do something different on each shoe.This can also be a cool way to up cycle old shoes, or just a way to pass the time if you are currently bored at home. It's a really easy art project to cure your quarantine boredom.

I plan on using some of these for my squishy makeover series, where I fix and redecorate  old squishies and create custom art creations. Let me know which squishies you think I should use in the next episode in the comments!FOR ANY NEW PEOPLE:Today I am going to be opening a bunch of boxes/packages from my subscribers. Basically fanmail or P.O. box unboxing, BUT most of these packages are used, dirty, old squishies sent to me from people who no longer want them. I like to fix them up, paint over them, customize them and decorate them to create new works of ART for my video series called Squishy Makeovers. Soooooo every once in a while I like to do these videos, looking through all the candidates I've been sent. It's always very interesting seeing which squishies I get and how bad of condition they are. Plus there are some cute extra gifts thrown in from my very generous viewers that are fun to look through. My current P.O. box address is kept private because I have been overloaded with mail in the past, so I only give it out by request to a handful of people each week (email address to request it, bottom of description). The address you see on a lot of the old packages in this video is NOT my current address, I no longer have access to it.

Today I am doing a video that was honestly DEMANDED by some people in my comment sections recently 😂 Many of you really wanted to see my attempt to Fix The Unfixable, sooooo, here I go. This special episode of squishy makeovers will be me attempting to fix and redecorate squishies from the WORST or worst. These extremely damaged squishies come from my hopeless bin and I was honestly not sure if they would ever make it out!Also, I am aware that this whole spamming of my comment setions kind of started a war between those who were doing it and those who thought it was really annoying 😂 I appreciate those of you who didn't want me to be pressured into doing a video I didn't want to do! Don't worry, I'm happy to give it a try. And I appreciate getting video requests from you guys.DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE COUSIN DERP PLUSH!https://moriahelizabethmerch.com/AND The new Christmas apparel design is now available here:https://moriah-elizabeth.teespring.com/listing/special-holiday-collection?product=345_________FAQs__________1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they were damaged, and no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be waaay too complicated/expensive and massively time consuming to keep track of everyone and return each squishy. I'm just one person! 3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh 😂 ) and this is my channel....obviously.

The testing craft kit/craft kit review videos are back! With a bang!....or bomb? Today I'm testing 2 DIY bath bomb kits that I picked up from Hobby Lobby. I've never made a bath bomb in my life, but recently I've been really interested in all the super creative bath bomb designs I've seen around. So I did this as a way to learn the basics of bath bomb making and hopefully also give you guys an idea of what you can do with either of these kits....it was an interesting experience. This is the first time I am filming in my new art room. I've been working on putting this room together ever since I moved and I'm so happy with how it has turned out! I hope you guys like it. I can't wait to show you the whole room in a future video.The first kit is by Mine2Design. I couldn't find a link online, but I purchased it from Hobby Lobby for $15.The second kit is by Klutz (this is an affiliate link)here's a link: https://amzn.to/2WmDen8Let me know if you want to see more bath bombs from me. I would love to try more intricate/creative designs (you know, once I learn how to make a bath bomb). particularly dessert themed like cupcakes, donuts (lol typical). just lemme know!___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___Every Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYsPURCHASE ME PRODUCTSCREATE THIS BOOK:https://amzn.to/2vUerfICREATE THIS BOOK 2:https://amzn.to/2Nx2G9fME MERCH:https://teespring.com/stores/moriah-elizabethGET TO KNOW MEVISIT ME WEBSITE:http://www.moriah.video/INSTAGRAM: instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficialCONTACT MEEMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART:Artwork@Moriah.videoFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES ONLY:moriah@nightmedia.co_MAIL ME_For sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address :)•FOR SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY PLEASE!

Today I’m going to be jumping on a recent trend (kind of, I’m a little late, but….better late than never?). You guys know how I’m obsessed with painting….basically anything. Well, the Hydro Flask re-usable water bottles have been super popular recently and I’ve seen so many people customizing them. I guess since they are pretty plain, they are just a perfect canvas for decorating and putting your own style on them. I put A LOT of time into 2 different hydro flask water bottles. I’ve noticed quite a few creators doing many of these in one video, but I decided to focus on just 2, and try to do a well-done, detailed design. I decided to paint one of them with acrylic paint and one of them with Posca Paint Pens, in 2 very different themes and styles. One is more “painterly” (we love that word LOL) and the other is a lot more bold and cartoony. I ended up loving how both of these came out, hopefully you guys like them too!

Today I am trying something a little different. I dug up one of my old, childhood art boxes, selected a couple (really bad) drawings out of there, and I am going to re-do them as an adult and see if I can improve them! These are really poorly done drawings, so I do a fair amount of roasting (you've been warned 😂 ), but remember if you are a beginner artist, it's okay to not make great art at first. In fact, even if you've been doing art for a long time (*cough* ME), it's okay if your art isn't the best. Don't fall into the trap of comparing yourself to other artists or put to much pressure on yourself. Most of us are just doing this art thing for fun. So do whatever is enjoy able for you! Okay. that's the end of my talk now 😂 This is kinda similar to the draw this again challenges I've seen from other youtubers. I was originally going to title this Re-doing my childhood artwork. BUT I realized this video has a super similar format to my squishy makeovers. There's an art critique section (squishy roasting) and it's all about taking something that doesn't look it's best and transforming it into something new. I ended up using a bunch of different media for these different drawings including watercolor, colored pencils and posca paint pens.Please let me know if you would like to see me do anymore videos like this (like I said, I've been able to find some more art since filming this). I had a blast with this, and it would be a great way to fill my sketchbook which has been a little neglected lol.in case you wanted to see that wreck this journal video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dlwhjIJbx4&t=94s&ab_channel=MoriahElizabeth___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh 😂 ) and this is my channel....obviously.

Today I'm doing a fun(?) little experiment. Locking myself in my art/craft room for 24 hours. Now, I realize that this is NOT that intense LOL. I had a lot of space to work with, food, an air mattress.....it was a pretty cushy set up. BUT the point of this wasn't really to be super intense or crazy, i really just wanted to see how much stuff I could make, being trapped in a room full of art and craft supplies, in 24 hours. Ummmmmmm. It didn't exaclty go according to plan. I know I was SUPER tired in the video especially toward the end. SORRY!!!! i hope you guys will still be entertained by it 😊 This is the kind of lame version of the 24 hour challenge 😂 If you like this, maybe I can do it again. BUT I'll step it up a notch. Maybe i'll actually keep to just one room. Not allow outside food. ban myself from the internet. Sleep on the floor. IDK, there are many things I could deprive myself of 😂 I did get some fun little projects done. I tested a couple small craft kits. DIY squishy kits (decorate me squeezables and smushy mushy decorate your own squishy kit). PLUS a kit from 5 below with those little squishy, mochi, rubbery things. ALSO, I did get it together and finish a colored pencil drawing in my sketchbook for you guys at the end. I hope you cats and cupcakes!MERCH STORE: https://moriah-elizabeth.teespring.com/The pickle shirt is no longer available. BUT, I just released brand new DECALS!!!!

Today, I'm gonna bring you guys along with me to paint over my old, boring cloth organizers. They're pretty plain and white and since I'm going for a very colorful look in my new art room, I thought I could give them a little makeover.I'm in the process of decorating my whole art room, so if you like this video, I may do more like this.These are the typical Ikea cube shelves that everyone and their mother has. I felt like this was something good to share with everyone because I've never seen anyone else do this, and I think it is a pretty easy way to put a personal touch on a room.Obviously you wouldn't have to do this as obnoxiously as me lol. You could be more subdued and classy with it. Or use stencils and whatnot if you don't want to free-hand it.TIPS:Fabric paint works really great on these, but if you can’t find fabric paint, make sure you at least use a paint that is flexible so that it doesn’t crack when you're dragging these in and out of the shelves. Probably not best to use something like acrylic paint. Unless you combine it with a fabric medium.WHAT YOU NEED:1. Cube Shelf  (I’m using the Kallax Shelf from Ikea)2. Cloth box insert (or you can use wooden bins)3. Fabric Paint (switch with acrylic paint if using wooden bins)Im thinking about how to decorate the remaining 4. Not sure if I should do them in the same theme, a different theme or STORAGE BINS (affiliate link):https://amzn.to/2JfiPh4VIDEO FACTS:–If you notice on my very “MESSY” plan, I was going to do metallic accents….obviously I changed my mind about that. I just decided I didn’t want that look…..–I wanted them to each be unique in the own way, but unify them with color. they all have a light rainbow, a dark rainbow and white accents.–I decided not to paint the sides, back or inside of the boxes (only the front) because1. Those areas aren’t visible unless the bin is open and 2.

Today is a highly requested video! I've been building this huge collection of panda bun squishies (thanks to you guys) and it was definitely time to give some of them makeovers!!This is a squishy makeover video, but it's a different format than usual because there are 8 makeovers instead of the typical 3-4. So, these are 8 ways to decorate a panda bun!These are also simpler designs than my usual, but I thought maybe this could be helpful for beginners or anyone who is interested in trying out squishy decorating. Panda buns are a great way to start out since they are so cheap, easy to find and such a simple shape!Here's where you can find some of your own panda buns (AFFILIATE):https://amzn.to/2PsIFxDWATCH THE WHOLE MAKEOVER SERIES: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...Wanna see unedited squishy makeovers, behind the scenes footage, biweekly video updates and get access to exclusive polls and q&as?CHECK OUT MY NEW PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/moriahelizabeth________ Materials List__________http://www.moriah.video/materials.html_________FAQs__________1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already. BUT if you have squishies that you really don't want anymore, email me at fanmail@moriah.video to request my P.O. box address :).2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. Everyone gave me these squishies as donations to the series because they were no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be completely impossible for me financially to send back squishies. Just to RECEIVE these squishies costs me hundreds of dollars (I have to pay for P.O. box fees) There are MANY other reasons as well, I explained it in this video if you want to know the full list of reasons: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKYCV...3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip and Scribbles. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.4. IS PUFFY PAINT THE SAME AS FABRIC PAINT?Yep!! Puffy paint is just a type of fabric paint.5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?I would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off. 7. WHAT MEMORY FOAM DO YOU USE?I usually just buy a memory foam pillow on Amazon.com and use that to cut up.8. CAN YOU DO MORE SQUISHIES IN EACH VIDEO OR DO MAKEOVER VIDEOS EVERY WEEK?I wish I could! But these videos take me about 30-50 hours to film and edit (not including waiting for the paint to dry or any breaks). And usually about 8 or 9 days of working on it. So it’s not really possible to do these any more than I am already doing without lowering the quality. PLUS! I want to keep up with my Monday videos and my art and craft videos as well ☺9. WHY DO YOU SOMETIMES USE A POPSICLE STICK AND OTHER TIMES USE A PAINTBRUSH TO APPLY PAINT?The “slick” fabric paint has a very thick consistency that does not spread easily with a paint brush. Using a popsicle stick is much easier for this type of paint. BUT the matte fabric paint is much thinner, similar consistency to acrylic paint and it can easily be applied with a paintbrush. When you mix the two, you can get away with a paintbrush as well :)10. WHY DO YOU LIKE RAINBOW SO MUCH?I just like color, and I think rainbows are pretty. There’s really no other reason for my obsession hahaPURCHASE ME PRODUCTSCREATE THIS BOOK:https://amzn.to/2vUerfICREATE THIS BOOK 2:https://amzn.to/2Nx2G9fME MERCH:https://teespring.com/stores/moriah-elizabethGET TO KNOW MEVISIT ME WEBSITE:http://www.moriah.video/INSTAGRAM: instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficialCONTACT MEEMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART:Artwork@Moriah.videoFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES ONLY:Business@Moriah.video_MAIL ME_For sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address :)MUSIC CREDITS:Intro Music by: SHIFTYPOPMusic: Love Light and Twinkles by JivingGerbil (link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwaUO...)Chee Zee Jungle - Primal Drive by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)Source: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100684Artist: http://incompetech.com/","Hey it's ME (Moriah Elizabeth).FAQ'SWhat editing program do you use?

I bought the book back in June, and I've been waiting for just the right occasion. Also, I needed time to collect the hair off my cat haha. I ended up not needed that much...I have quite a bit of fur left over. So if anyone needs a buttload of coffee colored cat hair, I gotcha covered 😂 I did have fun making this very weird cat themed craft. It's been awhile since I've straight-up crafted at all, so I guess making cat finger puppets was the perfect way to come back? If you're ever bored and want to make some unique crafts with supplies you have at home (if you have a cat), then I recommend trying this. Then give away your cat hair projects as gifts...your family and friends will loooove them and definitely not be weirded out at all. 😝 THIS IS THE LAST DAY TO ORDER PICKLE THE DINOSAUR.

Today is another one of my art or craft kit reviews. I used to do a very strict review style format where it's all about the kit and using only the supplies included. but now, it's morphed into me starting with a kit and figuring out what I want to make with it along the way. Even if it means adding or hanging elements of the kit. I've really enjoyed experiencing art kits this way because it allows me to customize the kit to fit what I want and get the best final result possible.Today I am working with the fizzy paint art kit by Faber Castell (link to kit below). This kit allows you to make your own watercolor and then gives you ideas for how to create interesting effects using the different tools provided. it's a pretty simple concept and the final results are pretty easy and basic. BUT, I think this would be great for beginners trying watercolor for the first times, OR if you want to use these to create simple backgrounds for your art (like I did). It's also just a fun, relaxing activity you can use for art therapy or as a creative activity  to do when you're bored at home.Check out My New merchandise!

Today I am doing a 24 hour challenge AGAIN. BUT, this time, I wanted to make it a little more interesting. I am not too big on challenges on my channel, just because I can't compete with the extreme challenges that so many other youtubers are willing to do LOL. I just like painting on things 😂 PLUS, I feel like a lot of challenges these days have gotten really pointless. But, this one is good haha. I decided to try  to paint and decorate different things for 24 hours. I have a lot of art supplies laying around my art room, just begging to be painted. But I don't often have the time to paint that much at a time. So this was a great opportunity to put a bunch of it to good use finally.I am going to be painting on a seashell, painting a pencil pouch, painting a rock, painting a squishy (mini squishy makeover lol), making a custom mug, decorating a giant clothes pin and a surprise weird item LOL.

I ended up making 4 different aesthetic slime creations out of the supplies I got - fluffy clay slime, rainbow slime, unicorn slime and more!

Today is another squishy makeover, obviously. I took care of the soft n slo cat with the tail, a unicorn (i mean, alicorn ugh) hugging on the moon, and a little surprise resident for my cottage from last episode (as promised). I had some struggles as usual, but I think overall they came out well. Do you like them?!?!?!Welcome to another episode of squishy makeovers, where I transform ugly, used, old, dirty, cheap or unwanted squishies (donated by my subscribers) into my own creations. I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!WATCH THE WHOLE SERIES: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...VIDEO FACTS:–I did the whole showing while editing thing for the first time. I have recently been using clips of my face from old videos to give facial reactions but I got tired of sifting through old footage, so i just quickly filmed those bits on my computer. not sure how i feel about it yet, or if it'll be a thing. i know a lot of other youtubers are doing that now also, so ehhh idk. after reading the comments, some people seemed to like it, some people didnt. we'll see! –Apparently having a male calico cat is super rare. A lot of people are saying it's impossible in the comments, BUT i looked it up and actually its just uncommon. About 1 in 3,000 calico cats are male. So he's jus special then haha :)–based on the comments, the bear in the bunny costume is a koala? I would have never guessed that in a million years. How are those koala ears!?!? And why is there a rim around the face as if its wearing a costume?! I have no clue. but a lot of ya'll are saying it, so I guess it is a koala. sure?? ________ Materials List__________http://www.moriah.video/materials.html_________FAQs__________1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they were damaged, and no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be waaay too complicated/expensive and massively time consuming to keep track of everyone and return each squishy. I'm just one person! 3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?I would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily. 8. CAN YOU DO MORE SQUISHIES IN EACH VIDEO OR DO MAKEOVER VIDEOS EVERY WEEK?I wish I could! But these videos take me about 30-50 hours to film and edit. I spend multiple weeks working on them (in combination with my other videos) so it’s not really possible to do these any more than I am already doing without lowering the quality. PLUS! I want to keep up with my art and craft videos as well ☺___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___Every Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYsPURCHASE ME PRODUCTSCREATE THIS BOOK:https://amzn.to/2vUerfICREATE THIS BOOK 2:https://amzn.to/2Nx2G9fME MERCH:https://teespring.com/stores/moriah-elizabethGET TO KNOW MEVISIT ME WEBSITE:http://www.moriah.video/CONTACT MEEMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART:Artwork@Moriah.videoFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES ONLY:moriah@nightmedia.co_MAIL ME_For sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address :)•FOR SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY PLEASE!

Thanks to Elmer's, I am doing a huge slime art challenge that combines art and slime in a super interesting and unique way. I am using slime to paint an enormous “paint-by-number” which was a 6 foot by 6 foot custom made canvas! I’m kind of a newbie with slime, but I definitely got some practice with this video! I got to make lots of cool colors including metallic and glitter slimes. Making slime was so easy with Elmer’s “Magical Liquid” slime activator. I can’t believe I hadn’t used this before! The whole process is super satisfying to watch and I’m glad to have tried something new. I hope you all enjoy the video!

Today I am going to paint an entire outfit!! I've painted on shoes, painted a jean jacket, painted on shirts on separate occasions, but today I am going to paint a FULL outfit at once to create a completely custom outfit. I have had so much fun in the past painting on that denim jacket and customizing my shoes, I was really excited to painting on my clothes. This was a super fun customization project. If you've never tried painting on clothes you should! There's some tiktok painting on clothes videos if you need more inspiration. It's a great ay to up cycle old clothes, or just have fun decorating things. Greaat art project idea for when you're bored at home.I am using fabric paint and leather paint on all of these items. These paints are flexible so that paint doesn't crack when you wear the clothes.If you stuck around to the end, you will already know that I am going to have to save the jean jacket for next week. I thought I would be able to paint the entire outfit in one video, but it turned out to be much more time consuming of an art project than I thought. I didn't want to rush through the jean jacket, since I have a really cool plan for it.

Hope you like rainbows, cute animals (or demon animals), fruit and desserts!It's been a trend recently to paint directly on the iphone, but I think I'm going to stick with the cases for now 😂 I really want to learn more about how to customize different items and how to make painted surfaces more practical for everyday use. So if any of you have any knowledge of what kind of techniques or products I can use to prep different painting surfaces, please let me know!Also, if you guys really love any of the phone case designs, I could work on getting the design printed on actual phone cases to put in my shop!

Today I am doing the highly requested art studio/room/craft room/squishy room/workstation tour....LOL. This is where I film my videos, paint my squishies, do thrift store makeovers and store all of my art and craft supplies. And I'm going to show you everything, open every cabinet and go through every drawer.WATCH PART 2: https://youtu.be/vUVgXayTn6EI went into a lot of detail (hopefully not too much lol), because I wanted to show you guys not only all my supplies and creations, but even all my weird collections. I have lots of my childhood stuff on display, in addition to all of my art, crafts, thrift store makeovers and squishies from squishy makeovers that I've made in the past. It's taken me about 4 months to put this room together, but it's finally done and I'm super happy with it! I hope you guys like how it came out. I've taken a lot of time and effort into the displays and also supply organization. This IS actually how I keep my room on a regular basis. I didn't clean it for the video haha. I actually really like everything organized and can't stand to work in a messy  environment.I know just how fortunate I am to have all of this. And I am sincere when I say, thank you to everyone who has been supporting me and watching my videos. This is really an awesome set-up. BUT at the same time, I never want to make anyone feel bad or feel like they can't make art or be creative if they don't have this stuff.You really don't need all of this to make great art, great videos or be happy. I want to make sure that I'm not sending the wrong message about that. As happy and grateful as I am for all of this, I know it's just stuff and it's NOT a necessity. I made the same kind of art and videos when I lived in a basement, and even though my set-up has changed, nothing else has.This room is a result of a LOT of hard work. I've been making videos for like 7 years and have just in the past year started to gain traction on my channel and able to make this a full-time job. It's been a loooot of hard work and effort to get to this point. This is my 2019 studio tour! Maybe, I'll do one every year to keep it updated.OH. also, this is only part one of my tour. It may not seem like a time consuming video to make, but this took FOREVERRR and I wanted it to be good. So I'm working on part 2, it will be up next Friday. Sorry! I just really wanted to do a good job with this. it takes timeeeeee.___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___Every Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYsPURCHASE ME PRODUCTSCREATE THIS BOOK:https://amzn.to/2vUerfICREATE THIS BOOK 2:https://amzn.to/2Nx2G9fME MERCH:https://moriah-elizabeth.teespring.com/GET TO KNOW MEVISIT ME WEBSITE:http://www.moriah.video/INSTAGRAM: instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficialCONTACT MEEMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART:Artwork@Moriah.videoFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES ONLY:moriah@nightmedia.co_MAIL ME_For sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address :)•FOR SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY PLEASE!

Today I am introducing a new idea for a video series, potentially. Depending on how you guys like this one. Well, I have to at least do 1 more because I still have a couple boxes to open, buuut whatever. 😂  I decided to have a little throwback moment and order some mystery boxes off of Etsy (remember when ebay mystery boxes was like THE trend on youtube?!). I wanted to not only have fun unboxing some random items picked by a stranger, but also throw a creative spin on this. My channel is all about creativity and making art, so I thought a cool way to incorporate some art would be to force myself to choose ONE item received from a mystery box and have to use it as part of some creative project. I will either paint on it, decorate it, customize it orrrrr something completely different, who knows?! It's a mystery! This ended up being a really fun video to make, so I am reallyy hoping you guys enjoy it, because I would love to do it again. If you have any recommendations for where I can buy some more mystery boxes, please let me know! I think this could get really interesting and be a fun way to discover new painting projects and find cool ideas for things to customize.

I wanted to make some DIY ornaments, or find some way to create custom ornaments. There aren't too many options for paintable ornaments, so instead of looking for something pre-made, I decided to buy a bunch of used ornaments, fix them up and paint on those. I think this is a really fun idea if you are looking for christmas art projects or creative holiday activities to do. I'm sure you could also find a bunch of great options at thrift stores if you didn't want to buy a whole lot.I had so much fun with this. It was really cool getting to put my own style on these ornaments. I would love to do more, how can I spin this to make it less Christmas specific? 😂 Painting on trinkets?

Ya'll are trying to give me a heart attack with the stuff you're putting in these packages. LOL I also thought about calling the thumbnail something went wrong.....you'll see why toward the end of the haul HAHA______FOR THE NEW COMERS (if there are any)________A couple of months ago, I started this series called “Squishy Makeovers.” I was using ugly, cheap squishies and then painting them, adding to them and fixing them up however I saw fit. That series became a new favorite on my channel, and I decided to allow subscribers to participate by donating their own ugly, used, broken or unwanted squishies. At the time, I had a much smaller audience, but quickly my channel grew and I became overwhelmed with tons of squishy packages.  I am still working on catching up with all the packages I have received in the last few months. I have spent 4 entire videos unboxing squishy donations, and this is the biggest batch so far. Everyone comments on these videos, which squishies they want to see in the makeover videos (4 candidates), and I give the most popular requests a makeover in the next makeover video (every other Friday). These pacakages are donation only, from people who no longer want the squishies or are just interested in seeing them on camera. The squishies are not returned to the sender after the makeovers. If that doesn’t make sense, I made a video to explain. I’d appreciate if you checked it out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKYCV...*ATTENTION*The P.O. Box address in this video is no longer open!!! I no longer have a P.O. box in this location, so any mail sent to this address will be automatically returned to sender.

Hey Guys! Today I am organizing and sorting through my entire squishy collection. This is every squishy that has ever been sent to me. They are all used, broken, dirty and a little germy, BUT I still love them!! I can't believe I've been sent so many squishies to use in my squishy makeover series. seriously unreal. So this is kinda like a clean with me video and a squishy collection video all in one. Stick around till the end to see a full, up close tour of my squishy collection after sorting. It's kinda satisfying to see how many of each thing I have collected haha.WHAT'S NEXT?–I know it's been quite some time since the last squishy makeover, sorry!! I am working on the next episode, it will be up next Friday! I hope you enjoy this video in the meantime. Thanks for your patience 😊 VIDEO FACT:–This was about 4-5 hours of sorting (not including the hour of set-up and the 2 hours it took to create the tour at the end). The editing was around 25 hours.___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___Every Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYsPURCHASE ME PRODUCTSCREATE THIS BOOK:https://amzn.to/2vUerfICREATE THIS BOOK 2:https://amzn.to/2Nx2G9fME MERCH:https://moriah-elizabeth.teespring.com/GET TO KNOW MEVISIT ME WEBSITE:http://www.moriah.video/INSTAGRAM: instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficialCONTACT MEEMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART:Artwork@Moriah.videoFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES ONLY:moriah@nightmedia.co_MAIL ME_For sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address :)•FOR SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY PLEASE!

Hey guys! today is another squishy makeover episode, with a little twist!!! I won’t spoil it…..but there’s a story here.I hope you guys enjoyed this format and the little addition of the “storyline.” I really had no plan of doing all that until I started editing and then I was like, um YES. Gimme the drama. The ceremony. All of it LOL.This video seriously took me FOREVER. I did 4 squishies total and 2 of them were super intense makeovers! Plus the editing was SO long. AHH! I felt like it’s been a little while since the last squishy makeover (because of the holidays), so I wanted to make up for lost time! I just hope everyone likes it ☺Welcome to another episode of squishy makeovers, where I transform ugly, used, old, dirty, cheap or unwanted squishies (donated by my subscribers) into my own creations. I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!WATCH THE WHOLE SERIES: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...________ Materials List__________http://www.moriah.video/squishy-makeover-materials.html_________FAQs__________1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already 2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. Everyone gave me these squishies as donations to the series because they were no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be completely impossible for me financially to send back squishies. Just to RECEIVE these squishies costs me hundreds of dollars (I have to pay for P.O. box fees) There are MANY other reasons as well, I explained it in this video if you want to know the full list of reasons: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKYCV...3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip and Scribbles. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.4. IS PUFFY PAINT THE SAME AS FABRIC PAINT?Yep!! Puffy paint is just a type of fabric paint.5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?I would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off. 7. WHAT MEMORY FOAM DO YOU USE?I usually just buy a memory foam pillow on Amazon.com and use that to cut up.8. CAN YOU DO MORE SQUISHIES IN EACH VIDEO OR DO MAKEOVER VIDEOS EVERY WEEK?I wish I could! But these videos take me about 30-50 hours to film and edit (not including waiting for the paint to dry or any breaks). And usually about 8 or 9 days of working on it. So it’s not really possible to do these any more than I am already doing without lowering the quality. PLUS! I want to keep up with my Monday videos and my art and craft videos as well ☺___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___Every Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYsPURCHASE ME PRODUCTSCREATE THIS BOOK:https://amzn.to/2vUerfICREATE THIS BOOK 2:https://amzn.to/2Nx2G9fME MERCH:https://teespring.com/stores/moriah-elizabethGET TO KNOW MEVISIT ME WEBSITE:http://www.moriah.video/INSTAGRAM: instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficialCONTACT MEEMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART:Artwork@Moriah.videoFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES ONLY:Business@Moriah.video_MAIL ME_For sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address :)•FOR SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY PLEASE!

CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they were damaged, and no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be waaay too complicated/expensive and massively time consuming to keep track of everyone and return each squishy. I'm just one person! 3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip.

Today I am doing another squishy makeover candidate unboxing video? LOL I never know what to call these 😂 It's literally been like 6 months since the last one and I had some super old packages laying around that I've been dying to open. I've been doing the spin the wheel makeover videos recently, but I think my next one will be back to normal, so make sure to leave a comment with which squishies you want to see get a makeover next! FOR THE NEW PEOPLE:Today I am going to be opening a bunch of boxes/packages from my subscribers. Basically fanmail or P.O. box unboxing, BUT most of these packages are used, dirty, old squishies sent to me from people who no longer want them. I like to fix them up, paint over them, customize them and decorate them to create new works of ART for my video series called Squishy Makeovers. Soooooo every once in a while I like to do these videos, looking through all the candidates I've been sent. It's always very interesting seeing which squishies I get and how bad of condition they are. Plus there are some cute extra gifts thrown in from my very generous viewers that are fun to look through. My current P.O. box address is kept private because I have been overloaded with mail in the past, so I only give it out by request to a handful of people each week (email address to request it, bottom of description). The address you see on a lot of the old packages in this video is NOT my current address, I no longer have access to it. Let me know in the comments which squishies you would like to see in the next squishy makeover episode.___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh 😂 ) and this is my channel....obviously.

So I wanted to dedicate a video to testing out the art trends that I've noticed around social media in the past year, but have never actually taken the time to try out. Last time I did this, I tried hydro dipping and it was a complete mess.....literally. This time I am doing acrylic pour, sometimes called pouring art or fluid art. This is a super satisfying form of art that has been trending for the last couple of years. This is also much bigger than a trend, many professional artists use paint pouring as their primary form of art. I must say, this was so fun to try. It's such a creative, relaxing and super satisfying abstract art form. At the same time, it would be easy for someone at any skill level to create. I hope you enjoy watching my test out this trend for the first time!Don't forget to check out my train of a hydro dipping video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaLrWkWuDjw&t=352s&ab_channel=MoriahElizabethHere is the kit I am using (affiliate link):   https://amzn.to/3c8X6Ur___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh 😂 ) and this is my channel....obviously.

Today is kind of a different video for me. I'm trying something I've never done before and experimenting with face painting, body painting, wigs, and DIY costumes in order to turn myself into a cupcake. Let's say it's in the name of Halloween....even though I kinda just wanted to do this regardless lol. I went for a cupcake because it's kind of my go to design. I've painted and drawn so many cupcakes over the course of my videos. I'm pretty much obsessed with making cupcake art. So, this seemed like the perfect option!I am a total novice when it comes to face painting, so this is a super easy face paint design. I know I'm probably making some big mistakes with the technique, but go easy on me, I'm trying 😂.  I have also created and easy DIY costume using clothes I already had in my closet and basically just decorating them. I think the final look came out very interesting haha. Hope you like it and enjoy the video!___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh 😂 ) and this is my channel....obviously.

So today’s video is….a little different. I was feeling a little overwhelmed with ideas (aka super spazzy, sorry about the intro lol) and so I decided to just kind of have a free for all today and not plan anything in advance….in order to avoid commitment hhaa. I gave myself a bunch of options for different art activities to do including painting squishies, making custom pencil pouches, painting on tote bags, decorating seashells, rock painting, custom painting vans, my sketchbook, decorating outlet covers etc. All of these I’ve done at some point on my channel. Some of them have become my kinda go-to, and some of them I hadn’t done in quite a while.This is kinda like a spazzy paint with me video 🤣 But, hopefully it can give you some fun ideas for things to customize.

Today is another squishy makeover, obviously. I took on a couple really unique ones today. Actually kinda scary....and creepy. Plus one super basic one LOL. Which makeover do you like best?Also. The Koala issue that I mentioned about my LAST makeover video (this is serious). I really don't think that squishy was a koala. Koalas have rounded ears (the squishy had long floppy ears aka a BUNNY COSTUME) and vertical noses (that squishy had a very horizontal nose: BEAR). It also had a very pronounced rim around the face (You can see it in the version I showed today, since it's a COSTUME!) Anddd it was otherwise just plain so i have no idea why most people said it was a koala. But, LET THE DEBATE BEGIN! hahahahaWelcome to another episode of squishy makeovers, where I transform ugly, used, old, dirty, cheap or unwanted squishies (donated by my subscribers) into my own creations. I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!I always try to give painting tips and advice, while trying to make i fun.WATCH THE WHOLE SERIES: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...BAKING VIDEOS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQIQMIZWG-Y&list=PL807ptvhwHpciWBzyd5NsZcWMRbwBGSFbVIDEO FACTS:–The ballet video of me I showed was from 2012. I was in 11th grade. I love how they edited the recording to zoom out when I fell. Trying to take attention away from the fact I literally fell on my butt haha________ Materials List__________http://www.moriah.video/materials.html_________FAQs__________1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they were damaged, and no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be waaay too complicated/expensive and massively time consuming to keep track of everyone and return each squishy. I'm just one person! 3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?I would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily. 8. CAN YOU DO MORE SQUISHIES IN EACH VIDEO OR DO MAKEOVER VIDEOS EVERY WEEK?I wish I could! But these videos take me about 30-50 hours to film and edit. I spend multiple weeks working on them (in combination with my other videos) so it’s not really possible to do these any more than I am already doing without lowering the quality. PLUS! I want to keep up with my art and craft videos as well ☺___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___Every Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYsPURCHASE ME PRODUCTSCREATE THIS BOOK:https://amzn.to/2vUerfICREATE THIS BOOK 2:https://amzn.to/2Nx2G9fME MERCH:https://teespring.com/stores/moriah-elizabethGET TO KNOW MEVISIT ME WEBSITE:http://www.moriah.video/INSTAGRAM: instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficialCONTACT MEEMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART:Artwork@Moriah.videoFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES ONLY:moriah@nightmedia.co_MAIL ME_For sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address :)•FOR SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY PLEASE!

I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating and painting videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try LOL). CURRENT SERIES:Squishy Makeovers: Fixing and decorating used squishies sent from my viewersThrift Store Makeovers: Fixing and decorating stuff I find at thrift stores/yard salesBake With ME: Recreating squishies I've decorated in real lifeCreate This Book: Drawing in the prompt book that I wrote (available to purchase and follow along)Squishy Unboxing: Opening used squishy packages sent from viewersCraft Kit Testing: pretty self explanatory. testing craft kits.___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___Every Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYs____PURCHASE ME PRODUCTS____CREATE THIS BOOK:https://amzn.to/2vUerfICREATE THIS BOOK 2:https://amzn.to/2Nx2G9fME MERCHhttps://me-merch.myshopify.comMORE MERCH:https://moriah-elizabeth.teespring.com/____ME SOCIALS____INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficial/VISIT ME WEBSITE:https://www.moriahelizabeth.com/____CONTACT ME____EMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART (Create This Book or Fan art only please):Artwork@Moriah.videoFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES/OPPORTUNITIES ONLY:moriah@nightmedia.co_____MAIL ME_____For sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address (mail accepted from those ages 13+ ONLY)ATTENTION: Unfortunately I can only respond to a small amount of people each week.

Today I am doing another squishy bakeover where I take one of my squishy creations from my squishy makeover series and attempt to bake and bring it to life. These are always such a cluster of fails and struggles since I obviously have no clue how to bake properly. But you guys ask for it, so here it is!Today I attempted to bake astrawberry lemonade swiss cake roll for the first time. It was a little tricky and has a lot of steps, but I managed okay for a beginner I think?And yes....I changed my intro. I am so nervous about it because I know you guys are used to the old one. But I really like the new one, I think it fits my current content style a little better. I hope you like it! This doesn't mean that anything big is changing right now, I am not ditching any of my current series, nothing like that.

I decided to spend this video trying to get my new filming room (actually just one wall of the room LOL) set up and ready to use. I think I got a decentiishhhh amount done, although this literally took me all day. I had 7 hours of incredibly boring footage to sift through haha.To be honest though, I quite enjoy making these more casual videos. I maaaay do some more in the future if you guys don't mind....but of course, I'll catch up on other videos first haha.My favorite part of this room is the art you guys made for me...LOLIf you want to send me art for my wall, send it here:Artwork@Moriah.videoPlease try to keep the somewhat relevant to me, my channel, or my videos....although I may accept ONE toad drawing...if it's good LOL.BTW.
