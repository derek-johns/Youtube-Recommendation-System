CHATWINS HOUSE TOUR!! We promised for 2 entire years that we would do the House Tour soon haha... and in 2019 we promised it would be in 2020. Today happens to be the last day in 2020, and although this was without question the hardest video we have ever made, I think you guys will enjoy it. It literally took all day, sun up to sun down to film, since we had to take breaks when the babies weren't napping and they kept wanting to play haha. It was tough but we did it. This is the offical Chatwins Chatfam house tour of 2020. Full entire house walkthrough of every room. Since we had triplets and a 4 year old, and a baby on the way, we had to get creative and strategic on where their rooms were and whether they should sleep with one of their siblings in the same room or not. Hope you enjoy the full house tour. Love you all and Happy New Year! Here's to making 2021 the best year yet. It's just a decision in your own head that you have to decide. We got this!

The 35-year-old Waddell broke her silence on the matter on Saturday, December 26, as she shared that she was very sad on Christmas Day following the split from 38-year-old Bass. Posting a photo of her and the couple's two kids, two-year-old Bella and 13-month-old Charlie, on Instagram, she wrote, “Merry Christmas. Christmas Day isn't what I had expected this year. The three of us. The new normal. Which feels incredibly abnormal, and actually very sad.”“A lot of you kind people have asked if I'm ok. And I want to say I am, but I'm not. I will be though. Today is the first day that both kids are staying at Evan's house overnight,” she shared. “I feel like I'm missing a piece of my soul. I'm literally just sitting by myself writing this. But I'm thankful that it was a white Christmas, and I'm thankful the kids all get to be having a blast with their dad and brothers.”She concluded, “They are feeling so loved. Thank you for checking on me. Love all of you.” The couple broke the news of their split to People magazine saying, “We have made the difficult decision to separate. We will always cherish our time together and continue to have the utmost respect for one another as we focus on what's best for the future of our family.”The pair first met and got engaged on 'The Bachelor' spinoff 'Bachelor in Paradise' in 2016, and were married in 2017 on the show. Though seemingly not interested in Bass at first, he worked his charm and they fell head over heels for each other as the season ended in a proposal. Fans of the reality couple grew suspicious of the relationship over the last six months. The pair swore off having more kids in June (Bass has three boys from a previous relationship) as Bass said, “I don't think we'd make it if we had another. We would make it for a little while longer, but … they would probably lead to different paths,” he shared on the Mommies Tell All podcast.    Waddell continued to fuel speculation that the relationship was on the rocks as she shared on December 6 in a vlog that she had moved, not mentioning Evan in terms of we.When Evan turned 38 on December 17, he celebrated without Carly by his side, only posting a photo of his kids who he called “My loves”. The pair announced the separation less than a week after his solo birthday outing and have since unfollowed each other on social media.0:00 - Bachelor star Carly Waddell divorce Evan Bass#CarlyWaddell#EvanBass#CarlyWaddellEvanBassDivorce","Mix News from Around the World the Definitive Guide to Information.

They got married in September of 2020 in the midst of a global pandemic in their backyard, with their officiant conducting the ceremony via Zoom. Their interabled relationship often confuses people, because much of society still cannot fathom people with disabilities being involved in loving, intimate relationships. Anyone who watches these episodes will quickly see their relationship is just as “normal” as any other. Sure, Hannah helps Shane use the bathroom and brush his teeth, but those activities do not detract from the emotional, intellectual, and physical connection they experience together.","We are Shane (he/him) and Hannah (she/her). We've been dating for over four years (and we got married in September of 2020), and we've discovered that people find our relationship to be pretty peculiar.
