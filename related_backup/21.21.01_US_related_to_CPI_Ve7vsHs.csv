This short and well balanced sequence provides you with everything you need to get your daily dose of flexibility, mobility & relaxation. Feel free to implement this routine in your daily workout schedule to get the best results. Physically and mentally.I´m also really happy that you enjoy my playlist for this routine.These are the songs I used:Michael FK - ChangeL.M. Styles - Wait on youFaith Richards - My CaffeineSarah Angel - LakeviewMuted - Belonging (it’s the piano piece)___Willkommen zur 15 Minuten Full Body Stretch Einheit! Zu einem ausgewognen Training, gehört auch ausreichend Erholung und Recovery! Daher steht an Tag 7 unserer Fitness-Journey eine wohltuende und ausgleichende Stretching-Routine auf dem Plan. Für mehr Flexibilität, Erholung & Entspannung.Ja, auch dieses Video kommt ohne Voice-Over ;) Bewusst! Denn entgegen einer geführten Stretching- oder Yoga-Einheit ist man hier wirklich mal ganz bei sich! Nur du, die Musik, dein Atem und ein kleiner Beep hier und da ;) Vielleicht öffnest du dich also heute mal ganz unvoreingenommen für genau diesen Weg. Auch wenn es nur ein einziges Mal ist.Es wird anders anders sein - davon bin ich überzeugt. Denn wenn es im Aussen still ist, wird es Innen oftmals ganz schön laut.Ich möchte dich ermutigen, dich einzulassen…Die Positionen zu genießen und zu erforschen…Gedanken, die währenddessen aufkommen, einfach zu beobachten…Gut sein zu lassen…Anzunehmen…Loszulassen…Zu sein!Darüberhinaus ist diese Art des Praktizierens ein gute Möglichkeit für einen Übergang zu einer Yoga Self Practise - also das eigenständige Praktizieren.Die Asanas und die Zeit sind vorgegeben, aber die Instruktionen sind dieses Mal dir selbst überlassen.Falls du also schon ein Weilchen mit mir Yoga praktizierst, nutze die heutige „no-talking-session“ doch gerne für eine kleine Bestandsaufnahme in Sachen Ausrichtung und Mindset. Was machen die Schultern in der Vorbeuge, wo sind die Hände im Vierfüßler ausgerichtet und wie hieß nochmal der herabschauenden Hund auf Sanskrit… ;)Das ist nur eine kleiner Impuls meinerseits, denn in meinen Augen bieten uns unterschiedliche Situation nunmal unterschiedlichste Möglichkeiten. Wir müssen nur genau hinschauen und sie wahrnehmen… und annehmen!Wenn du nicht dennoch sträubst, auch in Ordnung ❤️.Dann mache stattdessen gerne diese geführte Full Body Stretch Einheit (15 Minuten): https://youtu.be/qFgwrTc1e1IWenn du mehr willst, mache 30 Minuten Full Body Stretch: https://youtu.be/FUHzkAbrOlgUnd wenn du dich fragst, was erzählt sie da eigentlich, ich will mich doch einfach nur Dehnen 😂😂😂Perfekt! Dann bist du genau richtig hier ❤️Schön, dass du da bist.Alles Liebe.Mady 🤘🏼🐾********************************NO ADS!Wie in allen meinen Einheiten, schalte ich innerhalb der Videos keine Werbung!

Me too, I admit that. A 10min routine was definitely missing on my channel! Still a killer, still burning lots of calories, still breaking a sweat.. but: it's only 10 minutes :D This workout is:1. FILLED WITH BASICS. Nothing too fancy, nothing too dancy. Ask your male partner to join! They won't need to shake their hips for this one.2. a mix out of QUICK MOVEMENTS and ACTIVE BREAKS.  You will find Dolphin Holds & Planks in between all the quick movements. Almost feels like a break, but don't forget to keep the core strength :D3. HIGH ENERGY. For some reason it doesn't drag me down - but rather gives me MORE energy! Might also be the music though.by the way: NO LUNGES. __If you struggle or need a break: don't worry about it. Take a small rest, get something to drink & continue once you're ready :) most important is that you don't quit and push yourself. ▸ Depending on your fitness level, height and weight you will burn between 70-130 kcal. I burned about 80kcal in those 10min (which is a lot for me, I'm a small human and I normally burn about 250kcal in a 1h session). __▸ you can find FREE WORKOUT PLANS on my Instagram Channel. 30min, 45min and Beginner Friendly combinations.

YouTubers optimise their video's meta data for discovery due to how the algorithm is like. This isn't anything new. Most people who've been watching YouTube for years would understand this. If you're unhappy and get triggered by this, well, this channel isn't for you then. I’ve provided free workout schedules and programs since day 1 and have always optimised my meta data as such so that's not going to change.Having said that, it doesn't mean the workout do not work. You will still see results by following a suitable program schedule, watching your diet, being in a deficit or surplus (based on your goals), doing exercises in good form, etc. These are all equally important factors. You're not going to get abs, grow a booty, grow biceps magically from 1 or 2 videos, in 1, 2, 3 or 4 weeks cause everyone is different. I've explain multiple times throughout videos throughout my channel over years that it takes time and lots of factors, so don't take a video title out of context. Targetting fat loss is not scientifically proven. Everyone is different and it takes time. When doing any home workouts, do take precaution to exercise in a safe environment, and if you need help or you're not seeing results, I suggest seeing a health and fitness professional to give you tailored advice on your exercise form and dietary needs. I am not a medical professional and what I share on my channel are my views and what has worked for myself. Your health and safety is the utmost importance so find out what works for you.","Subscribe to my channel and find weekly workout videos, healthy food recipes and other fun videos!

Knowing this may help you lose weight. The body transitions by first using glucose from the food. In the second stage, it breaks down glycogen into glucose. In the third stage, it uses protein to make glucose, a phase called gluconeogenesis. After that, the body sustains itself mainly on stored fat.
