Lex Luthor then orchestrates a plan to get Batman and Superman to fight each other. But this isn't your typical Lex Luthor.

That is, until John Wick rolled around in 2014. This action-packed shooter with a simple plot became a surprise hit and introduced the world to some awesome gun-fu action.The movie does raise a few questions though! Like how did they manage to get the producers to get off their back about worldbuilding details and love interests? How does anyone feel safe at the Continental Hotel? Why didn’t Viggo stick around to make sure his men took care of John Wick, and why did John make a deal with Viggo just moments later?

But then came The Village… Lady in the Water… The Happening… Opinions started to change. Then came “The Last Airbender” in 2010, which not only solidified the new, negative public opinion of Shyamalan, but also enraged fans of the animated series around the world.The Last Airbender definitely raises a lot of questions. Like why rush through twenty episodes in ninety minutes? Why is there so much narration and exposition? Why are everybody’s names being pronounced weird? Why doesn’t anyone have any personality?

Spider-Man starring Tobey Maguire was a massive success, and so it made sense to start tackling some other Marvel properties. However, studios didn’t exactly know what to do with comic book movies just yet. Thus was born Ang Lee’s slow-burn, slow-paced Hulk movie in 2003 with the weirdest editing transitions known to man.Ang Lee’s hulk definitely raises some questions. Like why does it take so long to see the Hulk? Why is a movie about a giant green monster that smashes things so slow-paced? What’s up with Hulk fighting dogs? Why is everybody surviving these catastrophic attacks from the Hulk? And seriously, what’s with this editing?To answer all these questions and more, step inside the Pitch Meeting that led to Hulk!

Well, take a look inside the pitch meeting to find out! Subscribe to our channel: http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6 The Last Jedi has stormed into theaters. The film is certainly one of the most complex films set in a galaxy far, far away so you’ll be forgiven if you didn’t catch everything on the first viewing. There’s a ton going on in the background that you may not have even noticed and we’re here to help you find them. For example, did you catch that Rey stole the Jedi books? Blink and you’ll miss it! Luke’s final reveal was actually telegraphed well in advanced in a masterful way. Supreme Leader Snoke actually has a piece of bling that harkens back to Rogue One! Speaking of bling, what were those dice that we saw a few times? Luke has a stash of trinkets at the tree on Ahch-To, one of them ties directly to Star Wars Battlefront 2 while another may be a reference to the beloved Knights of the Old Republic video games. We get our first look, sort of, at the first Jedi while at the temple with Luke and Rey. Did you think Rian Johnson forgot about the famous line “I have a bad feeling about this?” Think again! We got to see the old X Wing used in a very interesting way and get a call back to a character from Rogue One in the form of a ship. Of course, being Star Wars, there are a ton of cameos in the film that you likely didn’t catch either, some of them being quite obvious! So strap in for the video and enjoy the ride!#SuperEasyBarelyAnInconvenienceVideo by Ryan George @TheRyanGeorgehttp://twitter.com/TheRyanGeorgeOur Social Media:https://twitter.com/screenranthttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRanthttps://plus.google.com/+ScreenRantOur Websitehttp://screenrant.com/","Screen Rant is one of the top authorities on movies on YouTube.

But to play the role of Wonder Woman, Gal had to follow a number of strict rules from Warner Bros. and make some sacrifices.To ensure total secrecy, DC does not tell anything about the role or project during auditions, so Gal Gadot only discovered she's aiming for Wonder Woman at camera reads. The studio also does not give the scripts to actor before the filming starts. Gal Gadot had to sign deal for 3 movies, and star in Wonder Woman and Justice League without even one day off in-between them!And doing Justice League reshoots with a new director on the fifth month of pregnancy was challenging enough.But with all that dedication, Gal Gadot signed a clause that she may be replaced in her superhero role at any time. The actress had to work out even harder than she had used to while serving in the Israeli army. Gal Gadot gained 17 pounds of muscle by spending 6 hours a day on intense workout routine.The most difficult part of her training though was learning to ride a horse!And while Gal Gadot did most of her stunts on her own, she needed a body double for a motionless scene with The Flash!How did you like her new Golden Armor suit? The actress confessed it took her a while to get used to how tight it was, and at first she almost passed out!To get into Wonder Woman shape, Gal Gadot had to cut cheat meals and stick to protein based diet.Still, the most important and rewarding rule for playing Wonder Woman is being a role model in real life, and Gal Gadot is nailing it!⭐OSSA is the best source for entertainment news about the celebrities we love.⭐Our YouTube channel dishes up celebrity news and gossip on the stars you admire the most.

That’s in a continued decimated exhibition marketplace that’s praying to reopen in 2021.Warner Bros.’ theatrical release of Wonder Woman 1984, which is also available on HBO Max for the next 21 days, grossed $5.5M, -67%, for a running domestic B.O. of $28.5M. From that kind of drop, it sounds like whatever moviegoing public exists out there finally got the message that they can see the movie at a cheaper price for the family at home on HBO Max. Either that or given the B+ CinemaScore on WW1984, word of mouth has stalled the sequel at the box office, and folks have figured out that it’s more economical for them to watch it at home. Warners has yet to provide hard numerical details on the spike in subscribers or viewership for WW1984 on HBO Max.Related Story'Soul' Jazzy In China While 'Little Red Flower' Blooms With $116M Debut; 'Wonder Woman 1984' Now At $119M Worldwide - International Box OfficeDespite the awful New Year’s weekend, many pics respecting some sort of theatrical window saw weekend-to-weekend gains in their grosses from the previous Christmas 3-day, i.e. Monster Hunter, Fatale, Croods 2, Pinocchio, War With Grandpa, Come Play, or decent holds, i.e. Promising Young Woman and News of the World. Also, showing that some moviegoing habits haven’t changed even with fewer people going, Saturday’s daily box office business for most of the top 10 films was, on average, +11% over Friday.While Warner is banging the drum on the global cume, now at $118.5M, which, let’s face it, would be significantly higher had the studio waited this tentpole out to a healthier time in the marketplace, box office analysts believe the Patty Jenkins movie will fizzle at around $40M in a domestic marketplace where 60% of all 5.5K theaters are closed. Warner’s Tenet, with the No. 2 chain Regal open during the majority of that pic’s run, halted at $57.9M. A reminder that with fewer box office DMAs open, the majors are also holding on their usual tentpole marketing spend.Meanwhile, read the @HBOMaxHelp Twitter feed and you’ll see that streaming glitches continue for the DC sequel, specifically the Roku device.

The Collector’s menagerie, for example, contains all sorts of references, from the notorious Howard the Duck to the slugs from director James Gunn’s Slither.

The show has almost exclusively revolved around Mando trying to bring The Child back to the Jedi, and during the last two seasons we’ve really come to see their relationship develop into a true father-son dynamic. As a result, it’s understandable that some fans can’t imagine what the show would be like without them together.However, contrary to what some may think, there ARE a number of potential new directions that the show can go. Based on the finale, the most likely direction would involve the retaking of Mandalore with Bo-Katan’s crew, as well as the possible continued Mandalorian civil war between her people as well as the Mando’s faction Death Watch. Along with this, we could get an appearance from the likes of Grand Admiral Thrawn, Sabine Wren, and the potential return of other familiar faces like Boba Fett! There’s honestly so much potential for where Favreau and Filoni can take us!So take off that beskar helmet, and stay awhile, as we discuss a number of possible theories for the third season of The Mandalorian!Chapters:0:00 Intro0:49 Return to Mandalore1:48 Darksaber / Feuding Factions 3:33 Grand Admiral Thrawn5:45 Sabine Wren7:07 Boba Fett7:41 GroguCheck out the Behind The Screen Podcast - By Screen Rant on Spotify!https://open.spotify.com/show/6sMJkP1E4N7kPYL5v9OW3vOur Social Media:https://twitter.com/screenranthttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRanthttps://www.linkedin.com/company/screen-rant/Our Website:http://screenrant.com/Written by: Aaron Redublo Narrated by: Grant Kellett @GtalkstoomuchEdited by: Aaron Redublo For copyright matters please contact us at: legal@valnetinc.com","Screen Rant is one of the top authorities on movies on YouTube.

Season 2 has promised to give us even more beasts and creatures than the first season, but that’s a video for another day. Season 1 has given us ravenous cursed beasts that devour all that stand in it’s past, horrifying insect like monsters with devastating power and even some of the world’s rarest animals- that are actually kind of cute. While some of the beats in The Witcher share similar origins to other creatures in pop culture, like Harry Potter, they are still very different and can be a lot more menacing. So, we are going to take a look at all of the magical beasts to appear in the first season of The Witcher going through their powers, abilities and weaknesses as well as their origins. Some of the beasts we see appeared in both the books and the games while others were created just for the show. So, get out your silver swords and take a health potion as we return to the dark and mystical world of The Witcher.Which is your favorite monster? Which beast and/or character would you like to see in Season 2?

In China, it made just $18.8 million with a overseas total of $38.5 million. It is pretty clear that WW84 is a victim of the winter's COVID-19 spike and the renewed lockdowns happening worldwide. It may make its money in the domestic market, but I’m highly doubtful.

That is a misconception, and needs an answer.While Christian manuscripts were destroyed in the Edict of Diocletian in 303, they were never destroyed by Christians, but by the Romans. Christians have never destroyed any of their Biblical manuscripts. Why would we?On the other hand Muslims were well known for destroying any Qur'ans which disagreed with their canonical texts, or which became too difficult to retain.Uthman in 652 AD burned all of the Syriana and Iraqi Qur'ans which disagreed with his Quraishi dialect. Then, by the time all of the official 30 Qira'ats Qur'ans were chosen in the 15th century, all of the hundreds of others which disagreed were destroyed. Finally, in 1924 when Mohammed b. ali al Husayni al Haddad chose the Hafs Qira'at as the official canonized text, all the other 29 which were in existence in the high schools of Cairo were taken out by boat and then dumped into the river Nile. So, the habit of destroying manuscripts of one's revelations is not a practice of Christianity, but certainly was of Islam.© Pfander Centre for Apologetics - US, 2020(44,670) friends-by-aleksound-from-filmmusic-io","Pfander Films primary interest is the study and explanation of all issues related to Islam.We will post video comments on youtube videos with Islamic/Christian themes, as well as new short talks on varoius subjects around this issue.","Pfander Centre for Apologetics Jay Smith Beth Grove Hatun Tash Sarah Foster Speakers Corner Hyde Park debates Qur'an Allah Koran Islam Muslim Christian ministry","4_Tm0SxIp6w"

Dan Sorensen’s helmet to helmet hit on Browns wide receiver Rashard Higgins should have been a penalty. Instead it’s a Browns fumble that resulted in a touchback. Andy Reid went for it on 4th down twice with backup Chad Henne in the game. Drew Brees threw 3 interceptions in the Saints loss. Tom Brady was denied a high-five by the official, and Deonte Harris had a punt return called back.

That's Good Sports delivers NFL news and ridiculous jokes to accompany your football addiction. Some sports shows are about hot takes. ThatsGoodSports is about silly takes.
