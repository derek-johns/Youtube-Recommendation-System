Joe Biden was sworn in on Wednesday as the 46th U.S. president, and Kamala Harris shattered gender and racial barriers when she was sworn-in as vice-president. In the Oval Office, Biden has already signed a string of executive orders. Jackson Proskow has more on Biden‚Äôs first day as president. Mike Armstrong reports from the streets of Washington, D.C., which has been locked down in the leadup to the inauguration. Hours after he was sworn into office, Biden signed an executive order to revoke the permit that would allow the Keystone XL pipeline expansion project to continue. Mercedes Stephenson has reaction from the Trudeau government. Canadian provinces each have their own timeline for vaccinating seniors who don‚Äôt live in long-term care or retirement homes against COVID-19. As Mike LeCouteur explains, seniors advocates say that older adults should be prioritized, regardless of where they live. Plus, Eric Sorensen reflects on this year‚Äôs presidential inauguration and Biden‚Äôs address compared to his predecessors.For more info, please go to http://www.globalnews.caSubscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDcLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQFollow Global News on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mtFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB#GlobalNews","Welcome to the official Global News channel on YouTube.
