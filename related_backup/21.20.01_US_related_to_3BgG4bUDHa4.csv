What makes this duel intense is the fact that Dubov has been Carlsen's second for his World Championship Match 2019. One of the main openings in Carlsen's repertoire for the World Rapid and Blitz was Dubov's Tarrasch and this same opening was played by Dubov against Magnus in this game. It's very interesting to see the dynamics here because Dubov has worked on this opening a lot and then Magnus has picked it up and now they both are fighting it out in this system.How did Carlsen respond to Dubov's Tarrasch.

At a time when America was seen as a backwoods nation with little cultural history and even less intellectual impetus, at a time when chess was considered the exclusive property of a few European countries, at a time when the game was played successfully by a handful of men wizened by years,  Paul Morphy, in the brief span of 19 months and with seemingly little effort, defeated conclusively every player he met.While today few non chess players even know his name,  he was one of the most famous celebrities of his time and within the hallowed halls of the chess playing community he is considered by some as the greatest chess player of all time.But this diminutive, unassuming boy rose to fame almost out of nowhere and once he secured his place in history, he retired back into that hazy unknown, shunning the public eye, never again to play serious chess. Not only was he one of great practitioners of the game, but also one of it's greatest enigmas. He's been given the sobriquet,  The Pride and Sorrow of Chess.Source: http://www.edochess.ca/batgirl/index.htmlFollow me on Instagram for extra content https://www.instagram.com/agadmator/Paul Morphy vs John RhodesBlindfold simul, 8b (1858) (blindfold), Birmingham ENG, Aug-27King's Gambit: Declined.

I’m Eric Rosen. I've been playing chess for over 2 decades and hold the title of International Master. I regularly live-stream chess content on Twitch (twitch.tv/imrosen) and put many of the best moments from my streams onto YouTube. My content is family friendly and geared towards players of all levels. I enjoy sharing my knowledge of chess openings, gambits, tactics, strategy,  and how to get better at chess. My videos feature chess games with instructional commentary, common tricks and traps, speed chess matches, blindfold chess, queen sacrifices, my beloved London System and Stafford Gambit, and much much more! Be sure to subscribe for regular chess videos!","chess tutorials tips instruction openings blitz bullet advice lichess.org lichess Eric Rosen imrosen chess tactics chess openings opening traps twitch chess strategy","3BgG4bUDHa4"

After a couple games into the arena, I begin following the games of World Chess Champion Magnus Carlsen, who went berserk in 36% of his games. When a player chooses to “berserk”, the initial time is halved and should you win, you gain an additional tournament point. This Lichess Titled Arena was the first of its kind with a blitz 3|0 format. I streamed this event at twitch.tv/ChessNetwork. Lichess Titled Arena March 2020 is held for titled chess players only, namely Grandmasters, International Masters, FIDE Masters, National Masters etc... Magnus Carlsen played under the account DrNykterstein for this event. Its $1,000 prize pool goes to the top 5 players, with 1st - $500, 2nd - $250, 3rd - $125, 4th - $75, and 5th - $50.
