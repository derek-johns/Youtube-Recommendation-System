This gentle class invites a full body awareness and focuses on a deep opening of the muscles around the hips, lower back, and legs.Our hamstrings can get tight when we sit too much or when we overtrain the quadriceps. When this happens, the hamstrings begin to pull down on the sit bones, making the pelvis and hips tight and flattening the natural curvature in the low back.Create stability while welcoming in a relaxing release as we work to invite equilibrium to both mind and body. Build your practice toward Sleeping Vishnu Pose!

We will introduce the powerful play of opposites in yoga asana as well, considering the ways in which we may join steadiness, or STHIRA, with ease, or SUKHA.I will guide postures today that are there not to discourage you, but to help you play with the concept of how to create a dance for both steadiness and ease, and one that is individual for you.

F√ºr mehr Flexibilit√§t, Erholung & Entspannung.Ja, auch dieses Video kommt ohne Voice-Over ;) Bewusst! Denn entgegen einer gef√ºhrten Stretching- oder Yoga-Einheit ist man hier wirklich mal ganz bei sich! Nur du, die Musik, dein Atem und ein kleiner Beep hier und da ;) Vielleicht √∂ffnest du dich also heute mal ganz unvoreingenommen f√ºr genau diesen Weg. Auch wenn es nur ein einziges Mal ist.Es wird anders anders sein - davon bin ich √ºberzeugt. Denn wenn es im Aussen still ist, wird es Innen oftmals ganz sch√∂n laut.Ich m√∂chte dich ermutigen, dich einzulassen‚Ä¶Die Positionen zu genie√üen und zu erforschen‚Ä¶Gedanken, die w√§hrenddessen aufkommen, einfach zu beobachten‚Ä¶Gut sein zu lassen‚Ä¶Anzunehmen‚Ä¶Loszulassen‚Ä¶Zu sein!Dar√ºberhinaus ist diese Art des Praktizierens ein gute M√∂glichkeit f√ºr einen √úbergang zu einer Yoga Self Practise - also das eigenst√§ndige Praktizieren.Die Asanas und die Zeit sind vorgegeben, aber die Instruktionen sind dieses Mal dir selbst √ºberlassen.Falls du also schon ein Weilchen mit mir Yoga praktizierst, nutze die heutige ‚Äûno-talking-session‚Äú doch gerne f√ºr eine kleine Bestandsaufnahme in Sachen Ausrichtung und Mindset. Was machen die Schultern in der Vorbeuge, wo sind die H√§nde im Vierf√º√üler ausgerichtet und wie hie√ü nochmal der herabschauenden Hund auf Sanskrit‚Ä¶ ;)Das ist nur eine kleiner Impuls meinerseits, denn in meinen Augen bieten uns unterschiedliche Situation nunmal unterschiedlichste M√∂glichkeiten. Wir m√ºssen nur genau hinschauen und sie wahrnehmen‚Ä¶ und annehmen!Wenn du nicht dennoch str√§ubst, auch in Ordnung ‚ù§Ô∏è.Dann mache stattdessen gerne diese gef√ºhrte Full Body Stretch Einheit (15 Minuten): https://youtu.be/qFgwrTc1e1IWenn du mehr willst, mache 30 Minuten Full Body Stretch: https://youtu.be/FUHzkAbrOlgUnd wenn du dich fragst, was erz√§hlt sie da eigentlich, ich will mich doch einfach nur Dehnen üòÇüòÇüòÇPerfekt!

To Lucid dream is to become conscious within a dream. Once conscious and aware, you can direct events in any way you like. You may for example want to act out some of your fantasies, seek answers to real life problems or gain other meaningful insight through thoughtful interactions. If you would like to give this hypnosis a try, it is best to do so an estimated 30 mins before you would usually fall asleep. For best results, it is recommended not to consume any heavy, processed foods and liquids (including caffeinated beverages) at least 4 hours before going to bed. If possible, no food consumption is preferable. This session uses the commonly known 'Reality Check' technique which helps you become aware of your current reality, whether it'd be in your waking state or inside your dream. Whilst in a dream, you are thus encouraged to become lucid. Our Reality Check will be presented to you in the form of several questions which you will be asked to answer based on your perception and awareness.The Structure Of Our Hypnosis:- Introduction- Awareness Practice (Preparation for the Reality Checks)- Relaxation- Reality Check (Whilst Awake)- Deepening of the Relaxation (Falling Asleep)- 'Lucid Dreaming' Hypnotic Suggestions- Deep Sleep (1 hour)- REM Sleep / Dreaming (1 hour 13 mins)- 'Lucid Dreaming' Induction (Spoken Words Return)- Reality Check (Whilst Dreaming)- REM Sleep / Dreaming (10 mins)- Reality Check (Whilst Dreaming - 2nd attempt)- End of SessionI hope you'll enjoy this session.

So go ahead and listen and achieve your deepest healing tonight.For more meditations & hypnosis, SUBSCRIBE here: ‚ñ∫https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrwE...Download this sleep meditation MP3 audio for offline access: ‚ñ∫http://www.progressivehypnosis.com.auFollow us on Facebook: ‚ñ∫https://www.facebook.com/progressivehypnosis/Follow us on Instagram: ‚ñ∫https://www.instagram.com/progressivehypnosis/Try some of our other positive guided meditations and hypnosis: ‚ñ∫ Lose Weight while you Sleep ‚ñ∫ https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4n7ExMd45cxg2pOGV4ZRgnjsmPwx2hFAHeal while you Sleep Meditations ‚ñ∫ https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4n7ExMd45czhcfO0LSW6jjqu_KyliLMQDeep Sleep Guided Meditations ‚ñ∫ https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4n7ExMd45cxLYkguaoI8ZZyVGmA0Nl7-This guided meditation/hypnosis is suitable for repeated listening.

To Lucid dream is to become conscious within a dream. Once conscious and aware, you can direct events in any way you like. You may for example want to act out some of your fantasies, seek answers to real life problems or gain other meaningful insight through thoughtful interactions. If you would like to give this hypnosis a try, it is best to do so an estimated 30 mins before you would usually fall asleep. For best results, it is recommended not to consume any heavy, processed foods and liquids (including caffeinated beverages) at least 4 hours before going to bed. If possible, no food consumption is preferable. This session uses the commonly known 'Reality Check' technique which helps you become aware of your current reality, whether it'd be in your waking state or inside your dream. Whilst in a dream, you are thus encouraged to become lucid. Our Reality Check will be presented to you in the form of several questions which you will be asked to answer based on your perception and awareness.The Structure Of Our Hypnosis:- Introduction- Awareness Practice (Preparation for the Reality Checks)- Relaxation- Reality Check (Whilst Awake)- Deepening of the Relaxation (Falling Asleep)- 'Lucid Dreaming' Hypnotic Suggestions- Deep Sleep (1 hour)- REM Sleep / Dreaming (1 hour 13 mins)- 'Lucid Dreaming' Induction (Spoken Words Return)- Reality Check (Whilst Dreaming)- REM Sleep / Dreaming (10 mins)- Reality Check (Whilst Dreaming - 2nd attempt)- End of SessionI hope you'll enjoy this session.
