He's been an embarrassment to the country, embarrassed us around the world. He's not worthy to hold that office, Biden said.However, Biden said he is glad Vice President Mike Pence will attend his inauguration.He's welcome. I think it's important that as much as we can stick to what have been the historical precedents of how an administration changes should be maintained. And so Mike, the vice president, is welcome to come. We'd be honored to have him there, and to move forward in the transition, Biden said.House Democrats are preparing articles of impeachment, expected to be introduced as soon as Monday. The President-elect did not weigh in on whether Congress should impeach Trump and remove him from office over his actions leading up to his supporters' riot at the Capitol this week.He said he and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris are focused on preparing their agenda to combat the coronavirus pandemic and bolster a battered economy.#Biden #CNN #News","CNN operates as a division of Turner Broadcasting System, which is a subsidiary of Warner Media.

And it’s just the beginning.I believe that the secular world is at its brink, and a new conservative age is rising.Join me each week as we examine these worldwide trends, discover answers to today’s toughest challenges, and together learn to live in the present in light of even better things to come.This is Turley Talks.","Trump politics current events nationalism populism conservative Europe Christian civilization Christianity Christian culture classical education America first","511SdWsvE5U"
