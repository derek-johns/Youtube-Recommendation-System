Enrollment is now open until Dec 27 at Monthly.com/MarkRober (link also in bio).This class is a hands-on, 30-day learning experience that will teach you how to use engineering and science to bring your creative ideas to life.During this class, I'm going to share with you my entire creative engineering process from start to finish. You're going to follow along with me as I fully design and engineer 3 brand new builds from scratch... from how I come up the idea, all the way through bringing the final builds to life.The best part is, over the month, you'll follow along with me and my process, side by side, and you will leave the class with 3 original, creative builds of your own.This is the class I wish I had when I was starting out. It's designed to take your skills to make cool stuff to the next level, whether you're a beginner or a more experienced maker/engineer.The class officially starts on January 4, 2021, and it will only run a few times per year, so claim your spot if you're interested!See you in class!-Mark","Former NASA and Apple engineer.  Current YouTuber and friend of science.  Answers to some common questions:1) I studied Mechanical Engineering in School.  I did my undergrad at BYU and Masters at USC.2) I worked for NASA JPL for 9 years, 7 of which were working on the Curiosity Rover (I made a video about it you should def totes watch cause it's probably my favorite of all my videos).  Then I created Digital Dudz (made some videos about this too) and eventually sold it after 2 years.  Then I worked for Apple in their Special Projects Group doing Product Design as a Mechanical Engineer for 5 years.  As of 2019, I just make my monthly YouTube videos.3) Link to free and therefore substandard build plans for my custom workbench can be found below.4) I made a 30 Day Creative Engineering Class that teaches my end to end engineering process so you can make stuff too!

Current YouTuber and friend of science.  Answers to some common questions:1) I studied Mechanical Engineering in School.  I did my undergrad at BYU and Masters at USC.2) I worked for NASA JPL for 9 years, 7 of which were working on the Curiosity Rover (I made a video about it you should def totes watch cause it's probably my favorite of all my videos).  Then I created Digital Dudz (made some videos about this too) and eventually sold it after 2 years.  Then I worked for Apple in their Special Projects Group doing Product Design as a Mechanical Engineer for 5 years.  As of 2019, I just make my monthly YouTube videos.3) Link to free and therefore substandard build plans for my custom workbench can be found below.4) I made a 30 Day Creative Engineering Class that teaches my end to end engineering process so you can make stuff too!

Welcome to iPhonedo, iPhonedo’s “do” is pronounced like tornado, taekwondo or nintendo. The name comes from “iPhone Dō”. Dō (道) Means road, channel, path. In Japanese Dō also means discipline. In 2007 I had a website named iPhonedo where I gathered information about iPhones. Then one day, just to make fun of unboxing videos, I uploaded a 13 minute unboxing video where I didn't even unbox the product. And now, here we are.I'm proud to be an independent reviewer and I'm not affiliated with any company.I prepare my own music and content.But enough about me, let's talk about you.You help me do what I do, you're the BEST!Even if one day You v2.0 gets released, you'd still remain the best.So thank you for being you, for being here and for all your support!All my links: http://www.iphonedo.com/contact/","technology in-depth review music creation garageband tutorial how to drone cinematic smartphone apple iphone ipad painting art tests independent true","Dqe7Iw2MiZ8"

As a blacksmith, most of the projects start as lumps of steel, or stacks of different alloys for making damascus, that I forge out into blades, sculpture, art or tools before taking the project to the machining equipment or into the grinding room for finishing. Each project teaches me a lot and stretches the bounds of my knowledge. I make a lot of mistakes but they serve as an excellent teacher. There's always something important for me to learn in the shop! I want my work to be the spark that ignites the desire for you to get into your shop (or kitchen/basement/garage) and make something too! Whether it's stitching a leather wallet or forging a giant sword, you'll love the creative process.Be sure to follow me on instagram @alecsteele for behind the scenes and grab some awesome products at https://alecsteeleshop.com/Thanks!

Cuando le preguntas a los vendedores de vitaminas por qué debes tomar suplementos vitamínicos aunque lleves una dieta saludable, te dirán que porque nuestra comida no contiene todos los nutrientes que antes contenía. Esto se debe supuestamente al agotamiento del suelo, al almacenamiento en frío, a la maduración de los alimentos de la vid y al transporte mundial de alimentos fuera de temporada. Y hasta cierto punto esto es cierto. Los alimentos contienen la mayor cantidad de nutrientes si se comen poco después de ser cosechados. Una fuente inesperada de disminución de nutrientes es la creciente cantidad de dióxido de carbono en la atmósfera. Esto hace que las plantas crezcan más rápido y se aglomeren en carbohidratos pero a expensas de otros nutrientes, por lo que en términos porcentuales la cantidad de nutrientes está disminuyendo. Por ahora, esta disminución es modesta, por lo que la suplementación con píldoras de vitaminas es probablemente innecesaria para la mayoría de las personas con una dieta saludable, pero puede ser una preocupación en el futuro.Gracias a Kate Pappas y Chris Kamen por escribir, producir y filmar este video conmigo.Editado por Lucy McCallumMezcla de sonido por Wayne HyettComprobación de hechos por Calvin Lee y Claire Smith Gracias a la Granja Infantil de Collingwood y a Glenn Fitzgerald de la Universidad de Melbourne y de Agricultura VictoriaActualmente ¿nuestros alimentos poseen las mismas características nutricionales de siempre? Algunos estudios indican que los alimentos estás perdiendo nutrientes esenciales para una buena nutrición. Para tener una vida saludable, es fundamental conocer los  tipos y grupos de alimentos y su función, qué son los nutrientes, los antioxidantes, proteínas, carbohidratos, cómo funcionan y dónde se encuentran. Necesitamos tener más información básica sobre nutrición a nuestro alcance, ya que hay una estrecha relación entre la alimentación y las enfermedades que debemos evitar.

As a blacksmith, most of the projects start as lumps of steel, or stacks of different alloys for making damascus, that I forge out into blades, sculpture, art or tools before taking the project to the machining equipment or into the grinding room for finishing. Each project teaches me a lot and stretches the bounds of my knowledge. I make a lot of mistakes but they serve as an excellent teacher. There's always something important for me to learn in the shop! I want my work to be the spark that ignites the desire for you to get into your shop (or kitchen/basement/garage) and make something too! Whether it's stitching a leather wallet or forging a giant sword, you'll love the creative process.Be sure to follow me on instagram @alecsteele for behind the scenes and grab some awesome products at https://alecsteeleshop.com/Thanks!

After some heavy deliberation, they decide to take matters into their own hands and go forward with giving him a taste of his own medicine by calling him back. Whether or not this is the man they're looking for or if they even SHOULD be calling him, remains to be seen.Leave your video suggestions here ➡ https://matthias.nolt.io/Leave your questions here ➡ https://AskMatthias.nolt.io00:00 - Recap from previous videos as well as a sneak peak at what's to come.00:46 - Should We Call The Cops?-With the safe open and its function known, it becomes the question among the group of if they should decide to test the police's phone number and see if it does indeed redirect the call.03:49 - Crack The Code -There's a code to open the computer (of course), so the team takes a 10 in order to go over all the possible phrases and passwords they have, just to see if one of them sticks.06:23 - Call It... -In order to take a break and step away from the computer for a moment, Matt makes the decision to test and see if the interceptor really is intercepting all of their calls, and makes a quick one to the police station.07:48 - Well, It Wasn't Them -After seeing the interceptor in action, the situation now becomes a little more real for the team, especially considering how many times they've attempted to contact the police in the past...09:32 - The Man Behind The Mask -With all the current information in mind, this so-called Syphus is starting to look more and more crafty and dangerous, especially when adding up all of the events that have happened in the studio thus far...12:17 - Should We Call? -One good thing that came out of testing that interceptor was getting a direct number to the Stalker, possibly. It's just the question of if they should call it or not.15:02 - Should We Turn It Off? -While unplugging the case was at first seen as the best suggestion, it now might not be as the team discusses what they should do: each step now is seen as more important than before.16:24 - He Answered -With the number now in their possession, Matt decides to call the number they saw appear when they activated the interceptor, just to see if  the voice he heard before matches if someone picks up.

This video garnered way more attention than I could’ve ever imagined, now over 9 million views. To say that I was shocked is an understatement.That one video was part of a whole chain reaction of events. Today, I’ll be addressing it all. There has been a lot of discussion about misinformation, the cheater in question, and Minecraft speedrunning as a whole. Three distinct topic areas that deserve their fair share of attention. I’ll be going through all three of them to give my take.I decided to make this video because I felt I had to. With my video still getting a considerable amount of views, it's only right that I go back and address some of the effects it had.- merch - https://zyphon.merchforall.com/- nordvpn - https://go.nordvpn.net/SH2sg- cloak - https://store.badlion.net/shop/Zyphon== Also Watch ==NiceTwice's Former World Record - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEt_uDiB3TM== Credits ==HOME (https://soundcloud.com/home-2001)oCloudys' Aftermath Video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4Vr37QZ_04== Other Stuff ==discord - https://discord.gg/H3kskMbsecond channel - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQN7Af9TG68t2Mi9AeW2CJAtwitter - twitter.com/ZyphonYTcool person - you#minecraft #minecraftspeedrun #speedrun","🐧 We are the penguin army 🐧  On this channel, expect to see Minecraft documentaries!
