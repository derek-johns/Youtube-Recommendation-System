According to RAM it’s the quickest, fastest, and most powerful mass-produced truck in the world, so in this video we’re going to check out the clever engineering that has gone into it, how it may dominate the Ford Raptor (perhaps not for very long), and throw in a few bad jokes to keep our spirits high. If you’re wondering if Dodge, Ram, and the likes of Chrysler have run out of ideas, well, the answer is no, because they still haven’t fit the hellcat engine into their entire lineup. To recap, we have a hellcat challenger, charger, grand cherokee, and durango. I know we’re all patiently awaiting news of the Pacifica, but in the meantime the good news is the mission of hellcatting all the things draws closer to success with the launch of the Ram TRX. Under the hood is yes, the beautiful 6.2L Supercharged V8 you’ve come to love from the Hellcat lineup. It produces 702 horsepower and 650 lb-ft of torque in the TRX. And the engine is ready to be pushed, with a cast-iron block, forged-steel crankshaft, powder-forged connecting rods, and forged-alloy pistons. Some changes versus the other hellcats include a deep sump oil pan to keep the pickup tube in the oil under high g cornering, and the alternator has been moved higher to allow for 32 inches of water fording.  The air entering the engine comes from two locations. Half of it is fed through the functional hood scoop, and the other half from a ram air intake at the front of the grill. If you have a big truck with a big engine making big power out in a desert environment, well, you’re going to need some serious filtering. That’s why the RAM Trex has not just one, but two air filters, each measuring about 8x12 inches. The airbox is mounted up top, helping allow for that high water fording depth, in addition to providing easy access for the owner to clean out the filter elements. Ram states based on industry-standard tests, the Trex can ingest dirty air and debris longer than any competitor before performance begins to diminish. Here’s a bonkers fact about how much heat this engine has to reject from the intake charge. At wide open throttle, the intercooler is rejecting 40 kilowatts of heat, all of this heat just from the intake air alone. As far as the four wheel drive system, there’s an active transfer case which has a low range with 2.64:1 gearing, and the transfer case will vary the torque split depending on which mode you’re in: auto, sport, snow, tow, mud, and baja. Torque is sent to the front and rear differentials, and in the rear is an electronic locking diff, paired with a Dana 60 solid rear axle with full-floating shafts. From the differentials, we move out to the wheels, which you can option beadlock wheels from the factory. The Trex has over 13 inches of wheel travel in both the front and rear. Up front is an independent, active suspension with forged aluminum upper and lower control arms designed to maintain the appropriate camber angles during their long travel. There are massive, 2.5 wide Bilstein adaptive dampers in both the front and the rear which use a single-piece aluminum construction with machined cooling fins for heat dissipation. In the rear is a 5-link coil suspension that allows the solid axle to travel up to 13 inches!Pairing the T-Rex side by side with the Ford Raptor, it’s pretty obvious what Ram was benchmarking. Many of the stats line up near perfectly, with the Trex having slight advantages. The most notable difference, really, is the power. 252 more horsepower, and 140 more lb-ft of torque versus the Raptor.

The one thing my spreadsheets wouldn't tell me was what the car was like to live with, what it looked like on the inside and what options were worth buying. I spent weeks going from dealer to dealer sampling everything from a VW Passat to a Mercedes C350 and the BMW 335i and decided there had to be a better way.","detailed drive driven crossover car cars review reviews car reviews auto reviews Alex Dykes crossovers Truck Autos AoA Trucks","1hsaGjOoT6Q"

As of January 2021, that exclusivity comes to an end, with Block becoming a free agent. And that means his options behind the wheel are now wide open. “Working  with Ford over the past decade has been awesome.” says Ken Block. “From racing all over the world, to accumulating  a half billion views from Gymkhana THREE to Gymkhana TEN, to creating the Emmy nominated series The Gymkhana Files for Amazon Prime - along with building a fleet of Fords including the iconic AWD Mustang Hoonicorn and F-150 Hoonitruck - it’s been a great partnership. It’s simply been a dream come true to work with the company that built the truck that my Dad drove when I was a teenager. I’m super appreciative to Ford for the support over the years, but I am also looking forward to what an unrestricted 2021 holds, and the ability to spread my wings a bit and play with a lot other toys.2020 was a big year for Block and his Ford vehicles. He took the overall win at Rally Barbados in a WRC2 Ford Fiesta, won his class (and 3rd overall) at Rally Legend in San Marino in his Ford Escort Cossie V2, and also won the first ever Projekt E race of the FIA World RallyCross Championship in Holjes, Sweden, in a Ford Fiesta. Along with winning races, Block and Hoonigan launched the all-new viral video series,- Hoonicorn Vs The World. Spanning 11 episodes, the series features Ken racing his 1965 Ford Mustang RTR Hoonicorn against a variety of wild vehicles including a McLaren Senna and the World’s Fastest Donk. The series has been viewed over 34 million times since its launch in late November. What does the next chapter have in store? Ken Block and Hoonigan Racing Division will be announcing new partnerships very soon. In the meantime, enjoy this video of Ken’s favorite Ford – the 1,400 horsepower AWD Mustang Hoonicorn V2 – get taken on its “last ride”.","Ken Block’s rally career began in 2005. His skill and car control became quickly apparent and Block aptly nabbed Rookie of the Year that season in the Rally America Championship. Since then, Block has also won 25+ national level rallies around the globe, scored points in the WRC, and accumulated five X Games medals...including winning silver on three wheels at X Games in LA in 2012 (behind 9-time WRC champ Sebastien Loeb). In addition to his performance in the car, Block has been a driving force in shedding light on the sport of rally within the United States. His keen branding and marketing acumen, combined with his talents and skills behind the wheel, has also allowed Block to achieve global fame as a rally driver through his wildly successful Gymkhana series of videos. A franchise which has garnered over 600 million views on Youtube alone.  Adding Climbkhana and Terrakhana to the franchises of videos in recent years, Block’s media properties continue to bring in new fans.","Ken Block Ken Block Gymkhana Hoonicorn Hoonitruck Ken Block Mustang Rally Rally racing","1hsaGjOoT6Q"
