He signed a contract worth nearly $15 million, with a $8+ million dollar signing bonus.  He's going to have a hard time spending all of that money, but it's entirely possible that he will.I diagnose where he's already going wrong and why it becomes so clear how these athletes go broke.

Cam Newton was benched for Jarrett Stidham in the second half after completing just 5 passes for 34 yards, and Bill Belichick’s normally staunch defense gave up season-highs in both points and yards allowed. New England was already eliminated from the playoffs entering the evening, but now they have to beat the Jets in Week 17 just to avoid ending the season on a 4-game losing streak. On the flip side, Tom Brady only had to play the first half in Saturday’s playoff-clinching win for his new team down in Tampa.

The news comes just hours after Haskins was benched and leapfrogged on the depth chart by Taylor Heinicke.“This afternoon I met with Dwayne and informed him that we would be releasing him,” head coach Ron Rivera said in a statement. “I told him that I believe it benefits both parties that we go our separate ways. We want to thank Dwayne for his contributions these last two seasons and wish him well moving forward.”Washington had high hopes for Haskins after selecting him in the first round of the 2019 draft. It was a move that the franchise came to regret, and Ron Rivera‘s regime had little reason to keep up appearances. Haskins didn’t inspire confidence in his second pro season and his Week 16 performance put their playoff hopes in jeopardy.Haskins started on Sunday in place of Alex Smith, completing just 50% of his passes for 154 yards, zero touchdowns, and two interceptions. He also lost a crucial fumble. NFL journeyman Heinicke took his place and looked a whole lot better. If Smith can’t go in the regular season finale, it’ll be Heinicke under center for the WFT.Per league rules, Haskins will be subject to waivers. If he goes unclaimed in the next 24 hours, he’ll be free to sign with any team. As a first-round pick his initial rookie deal is fully guaranteed, meaning that any team that claims him would be on the hook for $1.8MM in 2021 and $2.46MM in 2022. If he goes unclaimed, it’ll be Washington paying him that money.With those millions coming his way, it’s probably more likely that any interested teams pass on him on waivers and try to sign him to a cheap non-guaranteed deal instead. It’s a remarkable fall from grace for the former Ohio State star who was the 15th pick in the draft less than two years ago.There were reports that former coach Jay Gruden’s staff never wanted him, and that he was forced on them by owner Dan Snyder. Obviously, Rivera’s new staff had no connection to the pick, making it easier to cut ties. Due to his college accomplishments and draft pedigree we haven’t heard the last of him, but he also certainly won’t be handed a starting job anywhere after what he’s put on tape the past two years.He’ll finish his tenure in Washington averaging 6.3 yards per attempt with 12 touchdowns and 14 interceptions in 16 games and 13 starts. His best bet to salvage his career may be to try to find a team with an aging veteran quarterback he can sit behind with a coaching staff interested in developing him.source :  https://www.profootballrumors.com/2020/12/washington-cuts-dwayne-haskins-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Washington Football Team Release QB Dwayne HaskinsPat McAfee Reacts To Dwayne Haskins Being ReleasedReacting to the Washington Football Team releasing QB Dwayne Haskins | NFL RewindPeter Schrager on Washington releasing Dwayne Haskins talks Packers & Chiefs | NFL | THE HERDDwayne Haskins has been released by the Washington Football Team | SportsCenterA Timeline of Dwayne Haskins NFL Career On The Washington Football Team (FT.

Defense is the main need for Jon Gruden’s team but possibly getting Derek Carr another wide receiver would be something to consider. 2021 NFL Free Agency will be an interesting time with so many talented wide receivers like Allen Robinson, Chris Godwin, Kenny Golladay, Will Fuller, Nelson Agholor and JuJu testing the market. Should the Raiders sign the Steelers WR once he becomes a free agent in 2021?Raiders Report is presented by Panda Supps - If you’re looking to get into better shape, then you need to get started with the workout supplements Mitchell Renz uses.

Adam Schefter put out a report over the weekend around the belief Watson has played his last game with the Texans.
