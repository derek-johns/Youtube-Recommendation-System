They included Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, Kansas Sen. Roger Marshall, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville, among hundreds other congress members.At the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, we continuously evaluate our political contributions to ensure that those we support share our values and goals, said Kim Keck, BlueCross BlueShield's president and CEO, in a statement. In light of this week's violent, shocking assault on the United States Capitol, and the votes of some members of Congress to subvert the results of November's election by challenging Electoral College results, BCBSA will suspend contributions to those lawmakers who voted to undermine our democracy.The health insurance company's BLUEPAC political action committee -- supported only by employee contributions -- donated $246,750 to Republican lawmakers during the 2020 cycle. That included $10,000 to Sen. Tuberville, $1,000 to Sen. Marshall and $500 to Sen. Hawley.BlueCross BlueShield said it's stopping donations to all 147 Republicans who challenged the Electoral College results.#CNN #ChristineRomans #FirstMove","CNN operates as a division of Turner Broadcasting System, which is a subsidiary of Warner Media.
