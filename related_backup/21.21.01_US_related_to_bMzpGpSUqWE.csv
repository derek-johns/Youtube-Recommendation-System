Pag-usapan muna natin si Kobe Paras. Ayon nga sa article ng tiebreakertimes ay hindi makakasali sa final window ng 2021 FIBA Asia Cup Qualifiers na gaganapin sa Clark Pampanga sa darating na February 18-22. Ayon kay Paras ay personal reasons ang dahilan ng pag skip niya sa final leg. Si Paras ay nag average ng 3.5 points, 5.5 rebounds, 2 assists at 1 steal sa dalawang laro nito sa second leg na ginanap sa Manama Bahrain. Yes mababa ang mga averages na ito ngunit kung maalala natin ay nag laro ito out of his usual position na small forward. Nagsakripisyo ito. Sa tingin ko ay sayang ito ay sigurado na kung mapapasama nga ito sa final lineup ay possible na SF na ang laruin nito lalo na at andiyan na ang reinforcement from the PBA. Pero igalang natin ang desisyon na ito ni Kobe Paras. Siguro ay nakaaprekto rin talaga ang bashing na nakuha nito from the fans. Base naman sa mga nakita ko ay parang nasa kundisyon ito at nag-eensayo nga sa true focus under coach Jolo. Mapunta naman tayo kay Kai Sotto. Ayon sa mga balita ay uuwi si Kai Sotto this week upang makasali nga sa Calambubble. Kung maalala natin ay ang deadline for the players na pumasok sa bubble ay January 22. So possible na in 2 days time ay makikita na natin si Kai sa Inspire sports academy. Sa tingin ko ay risky decision ito lalo na at magsisimula na rin ang bubble tournament ng NBA G league. Pero sigurado ako na calculated risk at pinag-isipan namang mabuti ito ng kampo ni Sotto. Matimbang din siguro talaga ang pagnanais nito na matulungan ang Gilas Pilipinas lalo na at hindi nga umabot si Angelo Kouame sa final window. Sa mga kaganapan na ito ay lumaki ang tsansa nating manalo sa Korea at sa Indonesia. Sa kasalukuyan ay ang mga kumpiramadong papasok sa bubble mula sa PBA ay sina Raul Soyud, Troy Rosario at RR Pogoy. At sa gilas cadets naman ay sina Juan Gomez de Liano at Dwight Ramos. Ang mga ito ay expected na pumasok sakto sa deadline na Jan22. Ano sa tingin niyo mga ka-BALLero? Sa pag dating ni Kai Sotto at reinforcement from the PBA. Sigurado na ba ang tatlong panalo sa final window? Ikumento sa ibaba at pag-usapan natin iyan.
