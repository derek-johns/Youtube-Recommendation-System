With 90’s nostalgia being such a big cash cow, it only makes sense that a modern blockbuster reboot was attempted in 2017.The 2017 Power Rangers movie does raise some questions though. Like why does it take an hour and a half to even see the titular Power Rangers? How does Rita Repulsa speak English? How did the Rangers know how to form Megazord? What’s up with all the Krispy Kreme references? Why does Jason keep having car accidents anytime the plot needs to move forward? Did they really just slap the bad guy into space to save the day?To answer all these questions and more, step inside the Pitch Meeting that led to Power Rangers!

That sequel comes three years later in the form of Wonder Woman 1984, which in a historic first for a massive superhero blockbuster - came out on streaming at the same time as in theatres!Wonder Woman 1984 movie definitely raises some questions. Like why did Steve Trevor return through some random guy? Why are they using this man’s body for anything they like? Why is there a fully-fueled jet lying around at the Smithsonian and how does Steve Trevor know how to fly it? How does Diana know how to make it invisible? How did Wonder Woman get her lasso around Max Lord? How did literally everyone renounce their wishes? How did nobody wish the world to immediately end? What exactly is the message of this movie?!To answer all these questions and more, step inside the Pitch Meeting that led to Wonder Woman 1984!

I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.","memes dank dank memes country memes","4No-6Jhcfw0"

Today however we are playing the Sim City 2013 game that is now 8 years old and upon release was widely regarded to be the worst city builder and management game in the series. Today we will be making the worst city in sim city by not supplying residents with access to jobs, utilities like power and water heck not even access to food or fire services. This means the entire city will be a terrible place to live with bodies piling up on the streets. However thanks to some incredible video game design and balancing from EA simcity is broken and will still allow the worst city in the game to make great profit! We will be playing with all of the dlcs including the cities of tomorrow expansion that added perfectly balanced mega towers.So is sim city 2013 a perfectly balanced game with no exploits or if creating the worst city to live in is actually a profitable way of playing this city builder game! My goodness this really is broken! If you want a copy of spore you can buy it on steam here:https://store.steampowered.com/app/17390/SPORE/What you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold.

After agreeing to return all the Infinity Stones to their rightful places in time, Steve Rogers decided to go after what he wanted for once and decided to go back to live in the past with his true love Peggy Carter. Of course, this sparked some questions about whether Cap was always in this timeline or if he traveled to a different timeline and then hopped back when he was an old man. Given the rules of time travel that were established in Endgame and what we know about Cap’s character, it makes more sense that when Cap went back in time and stayed in the 40’s, he created a brand new timeline. And while we’re very happy for Cap, what does that mean for the future of the new timeline? Captain America knows about every major catastrophe that happens over the next 80 years and it would make sense that he would want to try to stop those things before Earth is threatened again. This idea is fascinating. Today’s video is all about Cap’s new timeline and the steps he took to prepare Earth for the ultimate threat of Thanos. First and foremost, before dealing with the Mad Titan, Captain probably went to rescue Bucky and stop HYDRA from infiltrating SHIELD in the first place. After that issue was dealt with, then Cap probably teamed up with Howard Stark to help develop technology that would better protect Earth from invading threats. How do you think this all played out? Well check out today’s video to find out at least one possible option! Once you’re done, be sure to hit that big like and subscribe button for more awesome MCU content like this.

You’ve come to the right place.  LegalEagle is all about giving you an insider’s view to the legal system.  Have some fun and learn to think like a lawyer.  I get asked a lot about whether being a practicing attorney is like being a lawyer on TV.  I love watching legal movies and courtroom dramas.  It's one of the reasons I decided to become a lawyer.  But sometimes they make me want to pull my hair out because they are ridiculous.  So I created this channel to answer your burning questions about the law and the legal profession.  While all legal movies and shows take dramatic license to make things more interesting (nobody wants to see hundreds of hours of brief writing), many of them have a grain of truth.

So when I needed them, they could fight the battles that I never could. Then, one day, after that team was brought together, a pair of twins birthed by the lord of hell himself, Jeff Bezos, killed one of the members of my elite team. Now, it's payback time.

(in text form)You’re probably wondering how I got from payback for a fallen friend to Disney princesses. It makes sense, just hear me out. Ya see, Disney movies are all about 3 things: love, honesty, and friendship, and money, and selling merchandise, and becoming a monopoly. The primary key in the Disney table that links it to the Murder table is friends. But we need to take it a step further, we’re not real enough yet. Look outside. See any animals? I doubt it, most of them are dead, but believe it or not they’re our friends. The problem is, they don’t know it yet. If I still love my dead dog’s ashes enough to make jokes about them, imagine how brutally I could smother a giant feral rat with my love. I want a pack of wild animals to love me, that’s why I’m a Disney princess, they like animals. To take a step back, to examine this from the comfort of a new paragraph, this is like the Fallout New Vegas Necromancer video only instead of resurrecting dead bodies and turning them into my companions, I’ve mastered the art of seduction and can make any wilderness creature weak enough in the knees that it’s practically begging to do anything I say. There’s just one small setback, because there always is. We’re well into 2021 now, it’s been an entire week at this point, everything must be as inconvenient and annoying as possible. It’s like a board game with your grandpa. You play Monopoly, there’s an argument about money, he says something about the war, you try to explain how real money is just as fake as the money you’re playing with, he shoots you in the chest and calls you a communist. A simple game turned into a mildly inconvenient evening. Did you think it was a real gun? Why would we let Grandpa have a real gun. All this means is its time for his medication. Sorry Josh, no consensual homicide this time. I got lost there for a second. Let’s get back to the beginning of the game. It was, ya know, pretty normal. I chose a woman as my race and made her as much like Cinderella as I possibly could. I thought maybe we were due for a tornado or something what with the sky and all. Alduin showed up and made the sky piss fire, I got my vision back, entered the keep, took a bucket, and went outside because I’ve got   to do. I used two mods to make this work. One allows up to 100 companions, as well as a bunch of other really useful stuff that I never used, and the other lets you tame any animal. But the Animal Taming mod uses spells for this. First you use a charm spell like Calm or Pacify to sooth the wild beast then you blast it with the Tame Animal spell and it’s yours. If you didn’t know there was a Tame Animal spell in Skyrim, it’s because there isn’t. It’s added by the mod and you can only get it from a certain someone inside the College of Winterhold. So not only do I have to get in there, I have to be able to afford the 2800 gold spell. You know what that means.","Welcome to Mitten Squad!

LegalEagle is all about giving you an insider’s view to the legal system.  Have some fun and learn to think like a lawyer.  I get asked a lot about whether being a practicing attorney is like being a lawyer on TV.  I love watching legal movies and courtroom dramas.  It's one of the reasons I decided to become a lawyer.  But sometimes they make me want to pull my hair out because they are ridiculous.  So I created this channel to answer your burning questions about the law and the legal profession.  While all legal movies and shows take dramatic license to make things more interesting (nobody wants to see hundreds of hours of brief writing), many of them have a grain of truth.

Gal Gadot, Chris Pine, and Patty Jenkins are back with more adventures of our favorite Amazon, along with Kristen Wiig and Pedro Pascal as the big bads in the movie. Early reviews are lukewarm at best and we understand why. The sequel has problems that the 2017 original film did not. The runtime, pacing, confusing plot points and character motivations – there’s a lot to unpack. Thus, Dwight and Swain are here with their podcast review. And hey, it ain't all bad. Kristen Wiig is terrific as the brilliant but awkward Dr. Barbara Minerva (aka Cheetah), and there's a mid-credits easter egg that will make you stand up and cheer.Spoilers abound on the episode, so you've been warned. Thanks for listening.SIDEBAR FOREVER ©2021 Dwight Clark, Swain Hunt and Adrian Johnson","","","4No-6Jhcfw0"
