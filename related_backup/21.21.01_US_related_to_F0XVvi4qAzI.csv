I just cannot and won't force myself to play and make content on something that just isn't enjoyable for me. I make content out of passion and share it with people, not to make money off of it. The repeated movements against creative, fun and innovative gameplay just reduce the game from a creative sandbox to a zero fun policy to me. There are dozen if not hundreds of positive bug fixes made, but the sheer amount of unecessary nerfs, inconsistencies, incorrect changelog mentions, bugs created out of bugfixes, unclear patch notes and countless other unecessary changes just ruin the game for me. Sorry if anyone was expecting interesting new content from me, but I don't want to make forced content on something I don't enjoy. I hope you understand.On another note, I am going on vacation for two weeks, so I can't make videos during that time anyway. Maybe I just need a break from my PC to recover from burnout.This video is not monetized because 1. I am trying to prove that I don't make videos only for money 2. I feel like if someone spends 41min watching this they shouldn't have to watch ads.════════Links:Outro song: Plaidness by Francis Preve════════My channel: https://youtube.com/nexnavynexusMy second channel: https://youtube.com/nexusdeMy Twitter: https://twitter.com/navyxusMy Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/navynexusnavynexus Discord: https://discord.gg/HUxgfG7Xploit Discord: https://discord.gg/pRqEBjKTechRock Discord: https://discord.gg/BNjvWgX════════#minecraft #bedrock","Channel oriented around Minecraft Bedrock survival utility.

I haven't been sleeping well lately. Lots on my mind as Christmas approaches. It's definitely different this year, I won't be seeing some of my family members this Christmas and that makes me sad... but I also have a lot to be thankful for!OH! Something SUPER cool happened to me! I was leaving my LZ last week after a PPG flight, and a guy in a truck pulled up next to me and flashed his lights. I stopped and opened my window and he asked if I ever saw any cows when I was flying... I told him I did, quite frequently, and he asked if he could have my number in case he needed help locating them (there are a lot of free-range cattle around here). Two days ago, I got a text from his son saying they were near my area and, if I was planning to fly, they would love to know if I happened to see any cattle. I told them I'd meet them at the field and when I pulled up, I saw three cowboys with lassoes sitting on three beautiful horses! I had a chat with them and they told me where they needed the cows to go. After I took off, I surveyed the area and while I only spotted one at first, eventually I found a large group of about 20, just a few miles from the LZ. I spiraled over the location and the cowboys galloped in my direction. Once I got low, I noticed that the cattle would run from me if I got close enough, so I started hearding a group of them together and in the direction of the cowboys. It wasn't long before I had ten cows stampeding through the wash, and the cowboys were close behind, twiring their lassoes over their heads! They were able to rope a few of them by the time I landed, and once I touched down, they paid me for my fuel and said they'd love my help whenever I'm available!It was honestly one of the coolest things I've done this year and from now on I'd prefer if you call me by my new title air-cowboy as I feel I have earned it. I hope to work my way up to space-cowboy someday. Gotta start somewhere!I wish I had a video... And I DO! Here's my GoPro footage of the whole thing! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkqaBzJIseMOk, the sun is coming up, that's my cue to go to bed.Love y'all!~Gabe","","[]","F0XVvi4qAzI"

He made a joke in one of his old videos that people took offense too even though it was supposed to be the opposite and the joke was sarcasm. odd1sout responded and people were mad at his response because people wanted him to use /s to express sarcasm and he is not doing that. But today we read the replies to the actual thread and determine if theodd1sout was cancelled and no he wasn't twitter failed miserably.My first odd1sout video:Theodd1sout is Getting Cancelled Over a Joke: https://youtu.be/RygLKKU3OWk","","[]","F0XVvi4qAzI"

This video is meant to refute these claims. I encourage everyone to watch until the end, especially if they watched the original video.In this video we hear from a statistical expert with a PhD that wrote a 19 page analysis on what the mods did wrong. I also disprove some of the claims made in the original video. All relevant information should be viewable below.Although I would have loved to attempt to refute the math myself, I suck at math and would have looked like a complete idiot. So, that's where an expert comes in.Expert's Report & Analysis - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yfLURFdDhMfrvI2cFMdYM8f_M_IRoAlM/view?usp=sharingWorld File - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pfA1HVWkROlFRG4egWh0GYV5SpbJGozR/view?usp=sharingTutorial for viewing level.dat, go to https://irath96.github.io/webNBT/ , and upload the level.dat file from the folder there.

I mostly look forward to the funny moments with my friends, and the challenge that it presents for me.Music From:Audioblocks,Lemmino - Cipher: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0q5PR1xpA0Karl Casey @ White Bat Audio","","[]","F0XVvi4qAzI"
