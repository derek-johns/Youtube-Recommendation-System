She developed a knack for music by studying piano and dance as a kid and listening to the likes of Busta Rhymes, Erykah Badu, Nicki Minaj, Drake, and more. Soon, she went from obsessing over Catwoman to “crate digging” on YouTube and learning Logic and composition on a midi controller. Cooking up vibrantly, candy-coated beats, dropping bars doubled-up on double entendre, and singing with claws out, Amala unlocks a sweetly sexy world soundtracked by wild hip-hop, twisted pop, and smoked-out R&B. Asserting a feline-esque dominance and a style that can only be described as every color in a box of crayons, Doja Cat’s unapologetic charisma, charm, and confidence immediately take center stage. With co-signs from Chance The Rapper, Katy Perry, Chris Brown and J.Cole among others, 2018's hit “Mooo!” propelled Doja Cat forward and added many fans to her already feverishly loyal fan base.","","6lOgh8torPA"

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.Oct. 1, 2020 | Bobby Carter -- In this Tiny Desk (home) concert, R&B star Jhené Aiko coasts through an eight-song medley that plays like the ultimate nod to her legions of fans — fans who've been begging for a Tiny Desk for a long time.The Los Angeles native's star status is a result of her music's versatility and vulnerability. Jhené Aiko Efuru Chilombo has carved out a space of her own over the past decade, despite a rapidly changing R&B landscape. As a songwriter, she leaves no stone unturned, explicitly expressing her struggle, joy and sexuality while always administering the vibe.Her latest album, Chilombo, released just before the pandemic hit the U.S., doubled down and leaned into the therapeutic nature of her songs — and that same aesthetic fuels her Tiny Desk. Backed by an ensemble of masked players, Aiko bookends her set with a sound bath of singing bowls that's peace personified through sound.SET LISTLotus (Intro)StrangerDo Better BluesTo Love & DieBorn TiredW.A.Y.S.Summer 2020Eternal SunshineMUSICIANSJhené Aiko: vocalsJulian Le: keysBubby: bassGracie Sprout: harpBrain Warfield: percussionCREDITSVideo By: Brandon ParkerAudio By: Gregg RominieckiProducer: Bobby CarterAudio Mastering Engineer: Josh RogosinVideo Producer: Morgan Noelle SmithExecutive Producer: Lauren OnkeySenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann","The official YouTube channel for NPR Music featuring Tiny Desk Concerts, live shows, documentaries and more.

It wasn't an aesthetic choice but a pragmatic one. Not even her love for a fresh set of bedazzled acrylics would get in the way of her strumming the soul out of her six-string Fender electric. The guitar wasn't the only thing she'd brought with her from Atlanta. In her lap sat Friend, the pink stuffed animal who no doubt provided a bit of emotional support during a five-song set that forced the shy enigma out of her creative shell.Look, I'm really freaking excited to be here but I have social anxiety like a mother******, Walker told the NPR crowd at the end of her set, barely mumbling the expletive in an attempt to censor herself. I'm freaked the hell out, I'm sweating, but this is so exciting for me.A 23-year old singer-songwriter with an uncensored pen and brown-liquor vocals, Walker has become something of a patron saint for colored girls who've considered bossing up when heartbreak is too much. With the release of her official studio debut Over It, she made history last week by racking up the biggest streaming week of any female R&B artist ever. Meanwhile, the first lady of upstart label Love Renaissance (LVRN) is lowkey leading a sonic revolution in Atlanta that's turning the trap capital back into an R&B town. Her team was equally insistent on tricking out the Tiny Desk space by hanging lights that brought a diffuse glow to Walker's creative set.For an artist who rarely grants interviews and admittedly dreads the public spotlight — despite an Instagram feed that clearly shows off her humorous, exhibitionist flair — Walker's Tiny Desk is revealing. In the span of 15 minutes, she performs fan favorites (Session 32, Wasted, Riot) and the song that made Drake hop in her DMs, Girls Need Love, before ending with current single Playing Games. Even behind the bright lights and oversized eyeglass frames, her unadorned soul shines through.SET LISTSession 32WastedGirls Need LoveRiotPlaying GamesMUSICIANSSummer Walker: vocals, guitar; Elijah Whittingham: guitar; Angel White: vocals; Autumn Tuesdae: vocals; Slim.wav: keys; Stox: bass; Remey Williams: drumsCREDITSProducers: Rodney Carmichael, Bobby Carter, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineers: Josh Rogosin, Patrick Boyd; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Niki Walker, Maia Stern, Beck Harlan, Jack Corbett; Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey; Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann; Photo: Laura Beltran Villamizar/NPR","The official YouTube channel for NPR Music featuring Tiny Desk Concerts, live shows, documentaries and more.

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.Bobby Carter | January 8, 2021I don't recall any other artist at the Tiny Desk harmonizing their own introduction, but Philadelphia's own Jazmine Sullivan didn't waste a second, greeting us all by flexing those once-in-a-generation chops from the jump. The singer-songwriter, draped in a trench coat while her band sports all black, are nestled in the corner of a dimly lit space resembling a cabaret.We don't see or hear much from Jazmine Sullivan until she has something to get off her chest. She drops a body of work every five years or so, shakes up the world of R&B with each offering, then quietly goes back to minding her own business. Her latest project, Heaux Tales, is a bold and timely conversation piece addressing truths regarding relationships, sex, social norms, self-worth and a myriad of other topics that women graple with. Each song is masterfully connected to another through unique yet familiar testimonies by women from all walks of life.She starts her Tiny Desk (home) concert with three extended and reworked selections from Heaux Tales, squeezes in thee fan favorite from 2015's Reality Show, then invites Tiny Desk alum H.E.R. to the stage to close with Girl Like Me. Ms. Sullivan, her background vocalists and H.E.R. ate this performance up and left not a crumb on the floor.SET LISTBodies (Intro)The Other SideLost OneLet It BurnGirl Like Me (featuring H.E.R.)MUSICIANSJazmine Sullivan: vocalsH.E.R.: vocalsAlisa Joe: vocalsNatalie Curtis: vocalsAyana George: vocalsDave Watson: drumsSimon Martinez: guitarJermaine Blandford: bassEric Wortham: keysCREDITSVideo: Mansa Twin Johnson, Mignotae Kebede, Evan MorsellAudio: Chauncey BurneyCreative Director: Amaya SeguraSet Design: Matthew EnglebertExecutive Producer: Omari WilliamsTINY DESK TEAMProducer: Bobby CarterVideo Producer: Maia SternAudio Mastering: Josh RogosinTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Morgan Noelle SmithExecutive Producer: Lauren OnkeySenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann","The official YouTube channel for NPR Music featuring Tiny Desk Concerts, live shows, documentaries and more.

In H.E.R.'s case, you get two. She stunned us as a special guest for Daniel Ceasar's Tiny Desk concert earlier this year, in an appearance that showcased her vocal mastery. That earned her an invite to play again, front-and-center. She attacked her second go 'round with more fervor than the first, highlighting her skills as a multi-instrumentalist, maneuvering between acoustic and electric guitars, then the Fender Rhodes.While H.E.R. stands for Having Everything Revealed, she's an artist who's built her reputation on a certain degree of anonymity. The cover art for her debut, 2016 EP, H.E.R. Volume 1, shows a woman's silhouette over a blue backdrop. Her visuals never provide the audience a clear shot of her face and her signature accessory for every outfit is a pair of large, dark sunglasses.As fans collectively squinted to get a better view, she delivered more projects. Another EP, H.E.R. Vol 2, came in 2017, followed months later by H.E.R. which combined songs from both volumes with a handful of new songs. The latter earned her five nominations for 2019's Grammy Awards, including Album Of The Year and Best New Artist Of The Year. She was born Gabriella Wilson to a Filipino mother and Black father. She first attracted the spotlight as a child prodigy, eventually signing a record contract when she was 14-years old. At 21, she's yet to release her debut LP.There were two standout moments during her Tiny Desk set. One came at the midway point of her biggest hit so far, Focus. When the instruments dropped out and background vocalists Ajanee Hambrick and Malik Spence chimed in with their lush harmonies, the audience melted. The second came when her focus was interrupted by a charming and sincere expression of gratitude for the Tiny Desk platform. For a split second it appears as though she's about to remove those sunglasses. Not saying that I'm your favorite artist, but maybe me being here today says a lot.Set ListGoing (Interlude)Feel A WayHard PlaceFocusCreditsProducers: Bobby Carter, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative Director: Bob Boilen; Audio Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Kaylee Domzalski, Maia Stern, Bronson Arcuri; Editor: Kaylee Domzalski; Production Assistant: Brie Martin; Photo: Cameron Pollack/NPR","The official YouTube channel for NPR Music featuring Tiny Desk Concerts, live shows, documentaries and more.

Sign up for CNBC Pro to stream the inauguration with commentary: http://cnb.cx/3iC88VlSet against a backdrop of a locked-down Washington, D.C., and a socially distanced ceremony, Biden, in his inaugural address, is expected to plead for national unity as political, economic and health care crises grip the nation. He will take over the presidency two weeks after a deadly pro-Trump riot at Capitol Hill and as deaths from Covid-19 continue to surge. Since the pandemic began early last year, the disease has killed more than 400,000 people in the United States.Kamala Harris will make history as the country’s first Black, female and South Asian vice president.The first members of Biden’s Cabinet are slated to be sworn in over the next few days, as well, including Janet Yellen as Treasury secretary. Biden’s Democratic Party, likewise, will assume a bare majority in the Senate after three new lawmakers – Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff of Georgia, and Alex Padilla of California – also take their oaths of office.» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision» Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassicTurn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

Apparently things didn't go very well for her and she left early. Jeffree, his makeup and his hair guy were talking a lot of mean and horrible things behind Trisha’s back. Things like her hair and her skin, her weight and how much money she makes and stuff like that. Just really mean and nasty comments. A long time friend of Jeffree - Tab posted a video explaining why he does no longer support Jeffree and talked about the Vegas Trip. There are also dms between Tab and Trisha, that show Trisha isn’t making this up and something really happened on that trip.🔴 Get my YouTube Creator MasterClass FREE for 14 days:https://skl.sh/34V3Kvt(You can unsubscribe before your first payment)🔴 Subscribe to my personal finance channel:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWeUT2TcnxwCzJeaMyt3bMQ🔴 Subscribe to my second channel:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt9IIZsLLXwmPcrEVAFhM8Q✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨FOLLOW ME! ❤️ 📸Instagram: @reyrahimihttps://www.instagram.com/reyrahimi/🐦Twitter: @rey_rahimihttps://twitter.com/rey_rahimi🎶TikTok: @reyrahimihttps://www.tiktok.com/@reyrahimi✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨🔗LINKS:- Earn cashback money with Rakuten: https://www.rakuten.com/r/REYHAN24?eeid=28187- Earn cashback money with Honey: https://www.joinhoney.com/ref/v9nj9lh✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨For business inquiries: reyhanehrahimi2@gmail.com✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨📺WATCH: I paid for ____'s OnlyFans so you don't have to:- Trisha paytas: https://youtu.be/LMT2ZbeMcbI- Nikocado Avocado: https://youtu.be/ahUGQLXljF0- Onision: https://youtu.be/3d_CWo6eov0- Lena the Plug: https://youtu.be/Q__mMarUnjk- iDubbbz's Girlfriend: https://youtu.be/qBCcw8PjHs4- Nick Snider: https://youtu.be/SIKV3GKX4zs- My subscribers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyBTtSeW2Ak&t=683s- Trisha Paytas (YET AGAIN): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGsW1T5VTqE&t=314sI- Tana Mongeau: https://youtu.be/IZaDei0YGeU- Trisha Paytas' sister: https://youtu.be/4-bE0AC1erQ- Venus Angelic: https://youtu.be/MlvIWBliQKA- Belle Delphine: https://youtu.be/kFKZrzdg9bc- Aaron Carter: https://youtu.be/7o-rbXxEzAI","Hi my name is Rey Rahimi and I spill tea","tea spill news spilled youtubers david dobrik logan paul jake tana mongeau trisha paytas rey rahimi rey rahimi","6lOgh8torPA"

A virtual parade hosted by actor Tony Goldwyn will follow.Mr. Biden is expected to sign more than a dozen executive actions on his first day in office.Later Wednesday, Tom Hanks will host a virtual celebration featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Bon Jovi, Justin Timberlake and Demi Lovato, among other artists. #Inauguration #JoeBiden #KamalaHarrisCBSN is CBS News’ 24/7 digital streaming news service featuring live, anchored coverage available for free across all platforms.

(My life)[Chorus]I get like this every timeOn these days that feel like you and meHeartbreak anniversary'Cause I remember every timeOn these days that feel like you and meHeartbreak anniversary, do you ever think of me?(Oh-ooh) Of me(Ooh) 'Cause I think of you, think of you(Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)📷 Picture By  Unsplash© For copyright issues or removal requests please get in touch at hieternitymusic@gmail.com.
